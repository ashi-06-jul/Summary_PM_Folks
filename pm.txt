14/03/2020, 17:43 - Jincen Matthew: Cool, will look it up. I was under impression that none of the players let you list your bikes for pooling. Anyway, will look it up. Thanks @919937536453

14/03/2020, 23:25 - +91 88618 77706: Thanks Utkarsh!

Hey guys, Rohan Patra here. I'm currently working as an APM at Walmart Labs Bangalore for their Canada market. Happy to connect with you all and looking forward to all the learnings and discussions üëçüèº
15/03/2020, 11:14 - +91 77986 38855: <Media omitted>
15/03/2020, 11:15 - +91 77986 38855: Good analysis of the larger market given the current environment
15/03/2020, 14:28 - Pankaj Chauhan: Govt is not even enforcing enough social restrictions, I don't think people are taking it seriously, even in India, in my private What'sApp groups where I receive info on private parties, number of parties have suddenly increased in Delhi, yesterday only there were two 12 hour parties, more are happening today, even in my hometown there are poojas and kirtans happening in full swing, how much will shutting school and colleges really help if entertainment scene and religious gathering are not shut down
15/03/2020, 14:30 - Adam Walker: interestingly, this is the point the UK government is making: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/03/the-british-approach-to-coronavirus.html
15/03/2020, 14:30 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Our commute in Delhi and Mumbai is down only 2%. So 98% are still going to office
15/03/2020, 14:30 - Adam Walker: obviously noone knows the approach, but it's interesting that that are some differing approaches to this
15/03/2020, 14:31 - Nazz: The stand up comic community has at least taken a stand. We have cancelled most of our shows and mics. No compensation for the artist community though. ü§ï
15/03/2020, 14:33 - +91 97413 36633: Assume this will change in the coming week. Lots of companies announcing mandatory WFH starting Monday until further notice.
15/03/2020, 14:35 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Yes. Will keep posted. This is for last 2 weeks. 
Bangalore has gradually fallen by 11%

15/03/2020, 16:59 - Nazz: If this doesn't wake up governments and citizens, I don't know what will. The panic is worth it.

15/03/2020, 19:37 - Adam Walker: can anyone confirm that the due date for income tax filings is 31st July? 
I'm only finding info (easily) from ClearTax: https://cleartax.in/s/due-date-tax-filing
15/03/2020, 19:49 - +91 87930 00818: Filing return is 31st July but for advance tax its 31st March. So all tax has to be deposited before 31st March for this financial year but you can file the return by 31st July
15/03/2020, 19:50 - Nachi: Advance is 15 March no?
15/03/2020, 19:50 - Adam Walker: what is advance?
15/03/2020, 19:50 - Adam Walker: Also, should employers have already generated Form 16s?
15/03/2020, 19:50 - Nachi: <Media omitted>
15/03/2020, 19:51 - +91 87930 00818: Oh yes advacne is 15th sorry
15/03/2020, 19:51 - Nachi: If u are a business or pay employees who are tds eligible etc, you pay govt advance tax. It‚Äôs basically calculating eventual tax burden and pre-Paying it
15/03/2020, 19:52 - Nachi: It‚Äôs a headache and I hate it
15/03/2020, 19:52 - Nachi: But govt i is its and charges interest if I don‚Äôt
15/03/2020, 19:52 - Adam Walker: oh got it. 

But what about for individual tax payers? I'm just filing my income taxes
15/03/2020, 19:54 - Nachi: I am not sure about individual taxes
15/03/2020, 19:54 - +91 88617 98719: If you think you have more income to show than what you have already declared that would lead to  more tax to be paid. if you dont pay now and file taxes later then on the due tax interest will be charged till the date of filing return
15/03/2020, 19:54 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: Individuals also can pay advance tax on a quarterly basis I believe. If you have any profit you made from sale of shares, etc
15/03/2020, 19:55 - +91 88617 98719: For example: interest form savings bank one ends up knowing end of year doesnt declare to emplyer and then while filing declares it , that leads to increased taxlable income and increased tax liability and since cut off is now IT dept applies interest as well.
15/03/2020, 19:55 - Adam Walker: actually I'm unclear. I remember filing taxes last year on my own. My employer did not do it. 
I'm comfortable with filing taxes, I just don't know when the deadline is for an individual tax payer
15/03/2020, 19:55 - Adam Walker: üëç
15/03/2020, 20:07 - +91 99020 11644: In general if you‚Äôre an employee you only have to worry about it on 31st July
15/03/2020, 20:08 - Adam Walker: thank you, Lakshman1
15/03/2020, 20:08 - Adam Walker: !*
15/03/2020, 20:08 - +91 99020 11644: If you have a lot of income where there is no TDS (tax deducted at source - ie withholding) then you have to make sure you pay advance tax every quarter. I‚Äôm presuming you don‚Äôt have such a situation.
15/03/2020, 20:09 - +91 88617 98719: But if you have extra income to show like savings bank interest etc. , interest applies, have been paying it for last 2 years :(
15/03/2020, 20:11 - Aayush: In all probability dates will move ahead
15/03/2020, 20:12 - Aayush: For all folks concerned, however this is just a probable case, not something that one can be sure about
15/03/2020, 20:12 - Adam Walker: Thanks for explaining everything.
15/03/2020, 20:12 - Aayush: It sounds logical to defer taxes for 1 month first and then to a quarter
15/03/2020, 21:20 - +91 99978 63008: Anyone from mobikwik here? One of my relatives have been scammed with credit card fraud. Need help with details of fraudulent transaction that has happened.
15/03/2020, 21:21 - +91 99978 63008: Also, any other suggestions on how to get the transaction reversed is also appreciated.
15/03/2020, 21:34 - +91 81233 27117: Call the bank most of them are proactive to reversing the charges
15/03/2020, 21:38 - Jasnoor Gill: On advance tax, taxes on any capital gains from shares/mutual funds/stock sales etc need to be paid quarterly by individuals
15/03/2020, 21:38 - +91 99870 94433: Yes one advantage of credit cards.
15/03/2020, 21:38 - +91 99978 63008: Even for cases where otp was shared?
15/03/2020, 21:39 - Jasnoor Gill: Nope, that's usually not covered
15/03/2020, 21:39 - Jasnoor Gill: Since they voluntarily handed it over
15/03/2020, 21:39 - +91 99978 63008: Basically it was a jamtara type  fraud.
15/03/2020, 21:39 - +91 81233 27117: Which CC is this?
15/03/2020, 21:40 - +91 99978 63008: In that case what's the next best steps one should take?
15/03/2020, 21:40 - +91 99978 63008: SBI
15/03/2020, 21:41 - Jasnoor Gill: Usually police complaint, then approach bank etc to track I imagine
15/03/2020, 21:41 - Jasnoor Gill: Not an expert. Recommend talking to a lawyer
15/03/2020, 21:41 - +91 81233 27117: Still report it and ask them to reverse it, especially if it‚Äôs less than 24 hours old.
15/03/2020, 21:43 - +91 99978 63008: They did that. Apparently the bank didn't entertain them a lot even after visiting the branch and its been two days now.
15/03/2020, 21:44 - +91 99978 63008: Let's see what happens next. Cyber cell says amount has been transferred to a mobikwik wallet and then transferred further.
15/03/2020, 21:44 - Jasnoor Gill: Branches are useless, cards are separate division. Call and ask to Lodge a formal complaint and charge back request
15/03/2020, 21:46 - +91 81233 27117: Oh yes one effective brute force is chargebacks. Either the merchant (MobiKwik) or the issuer (SBI) typically gets in touch with you the next business day.
15/03/2020, 21:46 - +91 99305 30939: SBI cards is a separate company than SBI bank
15/03/2020, 21:47 - +91 99305 30939: So call up helpline and file chargeback
15/03/2020, 22:19 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: File a chargeback
15/03/2020, 22:19 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: It is merchant liability in this case to prove transaction happened
15/03/2020, 22:20 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: In case of frauds, it is issuer liability (till the time statement is generated + 7 days)
15/03/2020, 22:20 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Hence please inform the bank asap
15/03/2020, 23:22 - +91 90088 02372: Hey, does anyone have a list of guidelines that they are following for wfh for the entire office? Any help would be super helpful!
15/03/2020, 23:25 - +91 99870 94433: someone posted this - pretty useful. https://twitter.com/amit_agrawal13/status/1238756652205125632

15/03/2020, 23:29 - +91 99870 94433: Yes it's from here originally.

I love it. 

I want to do this to pubs in Bangalore if community transmissions are realized. 
You guys know about the public ban "loophole" on bars - it only applies to "dance bars". WTF
16/03/2020, 11:30 - +91 98184 17804: There are companies that are still not WFH
16/03/2020, 11:31 - Nachi: 1) Bob's bar. i was just walking by last night, that place was packed

16/03/2020, 15:40 - +91 96633 75213: Yep, games and tv/video subscriptions would likely go up at this time. The last time we had the recession, I was working with an org in the TV subscription space, and we heard that people spent more time watching tv since it was one of the most inexpensive forms of keeping yourself occupied when you didn't have a job (this was around 2008-09)
16/03/2020, 15:43 - Suhas Motwani PM: üëã
16/03/2020, 15:45 - Nazz: People switch to mindless entertainment (more Rohit Shetty sold in cinemas) during a crisis. Right now, TV and games are the only option.
16/03/2020, 15:45 - +91 88617 98719: Could relate..have been thinking to renew PS4 subscription which haven't been renewing since long (its but pricey i feel).. applies to subscription space as well.can hotstar outbalance ipl loss with their other subscriptions.
16/03/2020, 15:45 - Nazz: I won't be surprised by shitty Netflix movies becoming blockbusters
16/03/2020, 15:47 - +91 88617 98719: Folks might buy subscriptions which they have been postponing like zee5, altbalaji, voot,hostar etc.. usual suspects prime, netflix will anyways get more traction.
16/03/2020, 15:48 - +91 88617 98719: Anyone trying ip tv apps here. Has helped me cut cable cost and also at times non prime/netflix subscription costs..
16/03/2020, 15:51 - +91 81233 27117: You are in for a treat! Sony has reduced the pricing of PS Plus recently.

16/03/2020, 17:54 - +91 99162 67475: Welcome @917733889552
16/03/2020, 17:54 - +91 99375 36453: @917720020392 is the reason why Indian companies worry about work from home!
16/03/2020, 17:54 - Aayush: Welcome @917733889552, you are in good company here.
16/03/2020, 17:55 - Adam Walker: exactly! jeez, don't continue this conversation now that Shashank has arrived. You'll induce an anxiety attack
16/03/2020, 17:56 - +91 96866 56459: Hi Shashank. üëã
16/03/2020, 17:57 - +91 99375 36453: Nice to see you here @917733889552 !
16/03/2020, 17:57 - +91 99375 36453: Haha. Ask @917720020392 and @918123327117
16/03/2020, 17:58 - +91 88617 98719: Great to see you here Shashank
16/03/2020, 17:58 - Aayush: So what have been the best practices to make work from home a success that has been discussed in the group yet?
16/03/2020, 17:58 - +91 99375 36453: Not enough time yet. Let at least 3-4 days go by?
16/03/2020, 17:59 - Aayush: I think we can make an active best practices message and keep updating it
16/03/2020, 18:00 - Aayush: This will also help with another group cause #Thread Summarising
16/03/2020, 18:04 - +91 97409 80880: Today was our first day at Mech Mocha and we had a lot of random fun, should see how things go along.
16/03/2020, 18:04 - Adam Walker: personally, I've used a Slack Standup bot in the past. I found this enormously helpful to get a digest of what my colleagues were working on, and to help me stay focused on my priorities. It is asynchronous, so it's lightweight for everyone to use. 

https://geekbot.com/
16/03/2020, 18:04 - +91 77338 89552: I was also thinking we should figure out more from an Indian context. There is info available from US standpoint on internet. But we have stuff like power disruptions etc. which I think need to be solved for through simple measures.
16/03/2020, 18:07 - +91 96866 27129: Oh that‚Äôs a good one
16/03/2020, 18:08 - Aayush: This is a huge problem and needs mitigation in some manner or form. Most people don‚Äôt realise how much electricity is a problem because most cuts are in the morning and afternoon sessions, which is when most people are in office.
16/03/2020, 18:09 - Aayush: This is principally because how the power supply and demand is maintained by cities and states
16/03/2020, 18:11 - Aayush: Also equally important to discuss: What about hard/soft activity capturing tools etc? Ethical? Best way to keep track? Should people keep track at all? Self-reporting?
16/03/2020, 18:17 - +91 88617 98719: Simple home UPS has been a saviour for me for wifi continuity and then relying on apartment power backup. Problem comes when there is long power cut and  apartment switches off backup after few hours... Then one needs to rely on 4G hotspot but can't do heavy duty work..

Everyone needs a target.
16/03/2020, 18:19 - +91 96633 75213: I've got a 8 hours backup for my home (-heavy duty machinery like geysers and fridges). Has saved my sanity for the last 8 years. üòÅ

Came to around 36k, but worth it.
16/03/2020, 18:21 - +91 88617 98719: Mine costed 2k and tv, fridge and wifi stays true for 15 min hoping society switches on power back and they do.worked well so far. summers are pain.thet wont run genset for more than 2-3 hours at stretch
16/03/2020, 18:30 - +91 77338 89552: Yes, we are also putting a UPS just for wifi üòÖ
Inverter still has a lag of a second to switch so isn't ideal.
16/03/2020, 18:33 - Sankshep Swiggy: Powerbackup, internetbackup... Some  learnings from day 1 for me atleast üòÇüòÇ
16/03/2020, 18:47 - +91 88617 98719: How about rental internet device  with high speeds .. technology needs to evolve for this though.. current 4g dongles are of no use.. the way plugo is  doing for mobile battery backup on rent.. OR moonshot - community high speed wifi.. pay and use..
16/03/2020, 18:47 - Aayush: Actually that‚Äôs a good suggestion, won‚Äôt MIFI devices solve most of the issue since most people use laptops?

16/03/2020, 18:48 - +91 88617 98719: Got few pings asking for UPS .so here you go.its there on Amazon
16/03/2020, 18:55 - +91 81233 27117: I thought i would save money working from home for a month. I had to order a UPS, AC and install one more broadband. And this is just day 1.

16/03/2020, 19:12 - +91 88617 98719: MiFi are  low speed. If 4g speed improves(has been downhill-Airtel specifically over last few months) they can do the job. But i doubt coders would be happy with 4G speeds. PMs can ;)
16/03/2020, 19:15 - +91 77986 38855: I actually expect Google Hangout to be the biggest beneficiary of Corona virus.
16/03/2020, 19:16 - +91 99020 11644: None of these will have lasting effects. Writing a blog about this. Will share here once I‚Äôm done - would love some feedback.
16/03/2020, 19:16 - +91 77986 38855: Zoom is quite expensive for any company to use. General trend is that a limited number of folks from a company have zoom license. As everyone goes remote, instead of using Zoom they will switch back to Hangout which comes free with all the Gmail accounts they have.
16/03/2020, 19:17 - +91 77986 38855: My hypothesis is that most companies will get used to Hangout and then normalize to it even after they are back to office; whenever that happens.
16/03/2020, 19:17 - +91 77986 38855: Critical assumption; Hangout doesn't suck as much as it used to earlier.
16/03/2020, 19:19 - Jasnoor Gill: Google has n meeting tools unfortunately. As for zoom, I think the benefits are baked into the price already
16/03/2020, 19:22 - +91 91084 44561: We are 100% on zoom across 14 countries and 40+ offices. We are also on Google app suite so have full access to hangout and google chat. We wouldn‚Äôt dream of switching. Once you have gotten used to features like zoom rooms, it is hard to see a way back. I have been in client exec board rooms where the a room of 20 people is patiently waiting while somebody struggles  with bluejeans or equivalent to project their display and get to the right view. With zoom it is effortless. We have also replaced our desk phones with zoom (running off tablets).
16/03/2020, 19:22 - +91 97409 80880: You can survive with 1 zoom licence for a team of 30
16/03/2020, 19:24 - +91 77986 38855: Yup, but zoom room is of little value once you go full remote. But I agree, zoom room is God sent and no alternative to that with hangout or anything else at the moment.
16/03/2020, 19:28 - +91 91084 44561: True. But then there is this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_O7rDILNCM :-)

16/03/2020, 19:38 - Nazz: We use it actively at my non-profit for online Intercultural Learning trainings and webinars
16/03/2020, 19:39 - +91 97571 63031: Has anyone here tried https://tandem.chat/?

16/03/2020, 19:45 - Siddharth Bangalore: interesting features but high call drops. The team got frustrated and shifted to slack calls. :(
16/03/2020, 19:46 - +91 91084 44561: We will have to start given the importance of workshops and facilitation to our work
16/03/2020, 19:46 - +91 91084 44561: I discovered the feature today tbh
16/03/2020, 19:50 - +91 72591 76020: Has anyone here built Gsuite add ons?

16/03/2020, 19:52 - +91 97571 63031: Do the call drops still happen or was it a while back?
16/03/2020, 19:52 - Siddharth Bangalore: I used it last in Jan. Don't know if they improved.
16/03/2020, 19:53 - +91 91081 65643: 2 of our guys had issues with mic randomly for a few seconds today, otherwise nothing else. You can ping the founder about this, he's quite responsive.
16/03/2020, 20:21 - Aayush: Is there any known list of WhatsApp based products?
16/03/2020, 20:21 - Aayush: Like that uses WhatsApp APIs and build products on top?

17/03/2020, 11:21 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Probably an off topic but I'm very keen to know experience of members in trying to apply product management lessons and best practices in real life . With family , friend to inculcate first principal thinking , initiate new habit , workflow and in general living with more agency in shaping environment and pathway. Do people respond to  trigger, feedback and incentive when subject is they themselves and not a food ordering app. Do people respond to data same way ? If not how you go about doing it than ? Or its fools errand and people don't change via a measured approach . I know a lot of us do that for health and diet but is there any example beyond these two .
17/03/2020, 11:21 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Let me explain with one example
17/03/2020, 11:22 - Prashant Singh Paytm: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 11:22 - Prashant Singh Paytm: This is one of many examples I noticed .
17/03/2020, 11:23 - Prashant Singh Paytm: My dad underwent a surgery recently ( which went well and he is recovering) . A lot medicine were prescribed. They need to be taken combination three time a day . There are 16 pills and capsule. Sorting and collating them after every meal was a time taking process so I ordered this medicine organizer from AMZ . A straight solution in my opinion, used a lot by caregiver in West . To my surprise there was a lot of resistance to using it .
Idle mind so I wore my PM hat and practices empathy by immersing in the context of user to understand source of reluctance . I found following

1) They like to double check prescription with medicine everytime they take meds . Hense I  made a check list with photo of pills and pasted of fridge .Like the way you see in washroom check list . In my opinion this was a good solution but it was ridiculed and laughed of as "faltu"

2) I noticed they use the wrapper of medicine to order again so I created a recurring event on their phone calendar with photo of prescription and wrapper . This goes every week when the meds need to replenish. Still rejected

3) I thought this a a time pass activity for them after dinner  so suggested few other like sipping green tea and crossword . They both like it but still no go

4)  I explained the risk of missing a tablet or two or tablets getting contaminated or getting moist due to heat and dust . Still not convincing

Am I forcing a solution for problem which doesn't exist or exist in my head .

What kind of incentive structure might pursuade them to give new system a try.
17/03/2020, 11:33 - Jasnoor Gill: Comes back to vitamin vs painkiller point, it's not a pain point for them, so don't try to force a solution where one isn't needed üòÅü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
17/03/2020, 11:35 - Prashant Singh Paytm: May be you are right but I think of it like people rejecting car in favor of faster horse .
17/03/2020, 11:36 - Jasnoor Gill: But that's the PM view, we are all in love with our products. Make your pitch, point out benefits, after that it's the users call whether they think it makes their life better or not
17/03/2020, 11:36 - +91 97046 73794: In that case - can you induce pain in the present workflow?
17/03/2020, 11:37 - Jasnoor Gill: No one encourages car usage by killing the horse and buggyüòÅ
17/03/2020, 11:38 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Right now only pain is me
17/03/2020, 11:38 - +91 97046 73794: üòÇ
17/03/2020, 11:39 - Jasnoor Gill: Put a 10rs coin in each days box? Think of it as giving cashbacks to encourage usage and temporary bump in behaviorüòõ
17/03/2020, 11:39 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Not vc funded
17/03/2020, 11:40 - Jasnoor Gill: Then find a use case with a genuine pain point, you don't have PMF with this audience at least
17/03/2020, 11:41 - +91 89715 76707: What is his current behaviour when it comes to consuming these pills ? What‚Äôs his approach ?
17/03/2020, 11:41 - +91 89715 76707: *your dads current behaviour
17/03/2020, 11:43 - +91 97046 73794: The incentive delta to use new workflow is not significant for them..

But this is a good example.. as PMs most of the times we are given problems to solve to improve PnL which need not have a upside for the customers all the time..
17/03/2020, 11:43 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Pick up the bag with wads of pills wrapper . Look at prescription . Pull out each pill tally it again and take it. No sorting of pills , no segregation based on time of meds , no ahead of curve ordering via monitoring inventory level
17/03/2020, 11:44 - +91 89715 76707: And is he consistent in taking his meds in this fashion ?
17/03/2020, 11:45 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Yup
17/03/2020, 11:45 - +91 97046 73794: What does your dad do? Is he retired? How engaged is he?

This may be his way of keeping him engaged. Probably the adoption of the pill box lies in him taking membership of a local club. üòÖ
17/03/2020, 11:45 - +91 97046 73794: Club = Association etc
17/03/2020, 11:47 - +91 89715 76707: If he is consistent in his behaviour , perhaps in his mind , your new routine is a fairly steeper learning curve ? Or doesn‚Äôt serve some internal heuristics which gives him comfort ?
17/03/2020, 11:50 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Yes .He is retired . I thought of introducing social proof by telling it's used in US by caregiver not effective. Doctor who prescribed the med was amused and impressed by my initiative and said it's good so authority certificate is there  too. I haven't tried using it via immediate neighbor or his morning walk club as I am afraid it will be seen as pushing to far to prove a point which brings it's own resistance ( like multiple notification deter us from making a purchase which we want to buy but abandoned incart for some reason )
17/03/2020, 11:58 - +91 89715 76707: One reason why this might not work is the anxiety associated with taking the wrong pill or wrong dose. The prescription and packaging go hand in hand. Outside of a package it‚Äôs hard to know what a pill is for. The prescription tells you name of the pill and quantity and packaging helps you identify it. Even though it might be time consuming it sure seems a lot more anxiety free as an approach.
17/03/2020, 11:58 - +91 99809 65477: I think this routine helps keep him occupied. If he's retired, 
this solves two problems for him -  using his time and taking his meds.
Secondly, they will probably never be as friendly with smartphones as we are, which is why the phone reminder fails. As for the checklist, we all try to avoid them being enforced on us, I guess.
17/03/2020, 11:59 - +91 99809 65477: +1
17/03/2020, 12:02 - +91 97046 73794: Got you. But the idea to get your dad engaged in other social activity is not to push adoption of your pill box.

Look at why is this a big deal for you? Because you have 100 things to do and managing the daily pills is a pain. 

There are the following personas -
1. Person who purchases
2. Person who gets the medicines out of the box and ensures all 16 pills are there
3. Person who consumes the medicines.

All the 3 activities might be done by same person. Consider changing the person who doesn't seem to understand the value? Like how about giving the responsibility of taking medicine out of the cover and ensuring all 16 medicines are there to yourself/wife/kid?

Or look at what lets your dad stick to the old behavior - maybe abundance of free time and no engagement. So get rid of his free time. Engage him in 10 social activities/ clubs.

To give an example - I personally love designing. Till a couple of years ago,  I would spend hours on Adobe suite/ Invision etc. Today I now longer do that.. I don't even have any design software installed now. Because now I have much more Excel sheet responsibilities. I hardly have time to for design.
17/03/2020, 12:04 - +91 98909 99199: We had similar story at home, with my grandma refusing to adapt with such boxes and notes. I think even the look/appearance of such boxes is too overwhelming for many such people.

So we created set of small paper envelopes, put the tablets in those and handwritten ‡§∏‡•Å‡§¨‡§π/‡§∞‡§æ‡§§ etc on those. Similar to what small neighborhood clinics generally give. Guess what- this trick worked very well.

As the PM/Product creators, we  give too much focus on efficiency, structuring (which may be right from our perspective), but the end user has his own habits & way of using things.
17/03/2020, 12:06 - Kumar Aakash: Narrative building and product marketing are critical to influencing/changing consumer behaviour .. your current approach lacks that. It just tries to solve for gaps that you perceive in the current CX 

#marketing is also product.
17/03/2020, 12:07 - +91 72591 76020: Also remember, it is not individual responsibility, everyone needs to pitch in. At my place all of us remember that by 11 am my dad needs to take tables. Even with that, at times we forgot.
17/03/2020, 12:07 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Changing solution modality by shifting to envelope from box . Interesting
17/03/2020, 12:09 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Explaining that its used by trained professional and safeguard against moisture and contamination don't qualify as narrative building?
17/03/2020, 12:11 - Kumar Aakash: It‚Äôs like harpic trying to enter India (Bharat India) and tell people it‚Äôs used in developed markets
17/03/2020, 12:12 - Kumar Aakash: Always needs Reinforcing the right narrative which would work with your core audience (your own folks in this case)
17/03/2020, 12:13 - +91 99020 11644: It‚Äôs not the solution which is faulty. Habits are strong and change management is tough. I recommend changing in steps rather than the whole thing.
17/03/2020, 12:14 - +91 89715 76707: Even to someone like me I find it hard to understand how a pill box safe guards around moisture & contamination versus the pills native packaging.
17/03/2020, 12:15 - Prashant Singh Paytm: One of the pill needs to be taken half after every meal so remaining half stay inopen
17/03/2020, 12:16 - +91 88617 98719: Homepathy doctors have solved this problem. You should review how they package and give meds
17/03/2020, 12:16 - +91 89715 76707: So the effort is really for that half pill right ? Wouldn‚Äôt it be easier just to put that one half pill in a small container and let the rest be in original packaging?
17/03/2020, 12:17 - +91 99020 11644: With all due respect, homeopathy is not a science. And their practitioners should not be called ‚ÄúDoctors‚Äù
17/03/2020, 12:17 - Prashant Singh Paytm: True but I see this case as a test for my pm skills üôÇ
17/03/2020, 12:18 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Think of it like a feature for PnL enhancement not user benifit only
17/03/2020, 12:19 - +91 89715 76707: But then aren‚Äôt we over engineering a solution ? IMHO isn‚Äôt the PMs skill to solve for the users problem and not for the PMs skill üôÉ
17/03/2020, 12:21 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Well let's imagine as thought experiment that this box manufacturer wants to increase the usage and he gets a database of people who taje lots of meds daily how will he go about it
17/03/2020, 12:21 - +91 88617 98719: Wont argue on that. But focus there is  on packaging meds by numbering and for different times of the day. See number and take..
17/03/2020, 12:22 - Prashant Singh Paytm: My dad think I'm overdoing it üôÇ
17/03/2020, 12:28 - Nazz: This is what you need. https://www.amazon.in/Made-Stick-Ideas-Survive-Others/dp/1400064287
17/03/2020, 12:32 - +91 89715 76707: Well there in lies the problem. The box manufacturers has already made a product and is trying to fit it into the users life. The solution hasn‚Äôt stemmed from understanding user behaviour. The only strong enough natural motivator is social conformity which you can enforce through doctors. If you want to take it a notch higher, get the chemists to do your repackaging and charge a fee for this service. - response to a thought experiment.
17/03/2020, 12:35 - +91 97046 73794: PnL enhancement would still require you to work with the user personas and make their lives easier.

I'll give you one PnL enhancement example -  Payment collection in healthcare. It's a pain to get money from the clinics/ hospitals. We want them to go online. Every payment collection visit means ~750/- in TnL for us.. Clinics/Hospitals don't care. They still want a hardcopy invoice with a person bringing it to their doorstep and they paying whenever they like. They don't give ACH mandates or talk about NEFT etc. They want to handover a PDC.

Now to solve this, how about making an ally in the hospital. One of their peons. We can give that guy a 350rs per payment collection. He will go and take a print out of the invoice, get it signed, collect cheque, deposit the cheque etc. 

What I am saying is.. solving the problem requires you to induce an incentive.
17/03/2020, 12:41 - +91 97046 73794: But that's how most of our day to day jobs are. Isn't it?

I have tens of problem statement at work which are required for business but may not necessarily have an incentive for end user.

Like I mentioned above payment collection, self-installation/onboarding, chat adoption over customer support calls, app adoption etc.

App adoption is a big one.. Tricog is a service like Telecom. You need not have an app to use it. But we require app/portal adoption. Why? Because tens of costs can be brought down by moving the customers to the app. Like reports, bill payment, customer support etc. But customers don't care. How do you build for this? We induce pain in present workflow/ value in new workflow. Get incentive delta higher for newer workflows. That's about it.

Like removing diagnosis from sms and instead sending link to view report. Doctor definitely will have to click the link to consume. Induced pain is not significant enough that customer will churn.
17/03/2020, 12:51 - +91 96633 75213: There's a clue there. Will avoid repeating what everyone's saying. The customer should think it's a pain point that needs to be acted on IMMEDIATELY, else there's resistance due to existing habits.

Like when you try and explain to an overweight person why they should go to the gym. You can offer your help, but if they don't want it.. back off. Solve a different problem.

17/03/2020, 15:48 - Aamna Khan: Anyone here who has done extensive instagram marketing & experiments? Looking to get a jumpstart. Virtual coffee on me.
17/03/2020, 15:50 - +91 97690 03072: What's the product vertical you're looking to sell?
17/03/2020, 16:02 - Aamna Khan: Women's clothing but I'm open to talking to someone from a completely different segment as well. I think it'll be useful in general
17/03/2020, 16:04 - +91 99809 65477: Are you considering only Instagram or Facebook as well?
17/03/2020, 16:13 - +91 97690 03072: PMing

17/03/2020, 18:22 - +91 70425 00365: Hi,

Gourav Baldewa here.

Currently, I am working as a Product Manager at Bounce, 2-wheeler dockless bike rental company.
Focussed on launching new businesses

Prior to this, I was working in the Digital vertical of  McKinsey & Co as Senior Product Owner.

 I helped build, operate and tranfer digital products for players in Banking, telecom and insurance sector both in India and South-East Asia
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Kumar Aakash: Here‚Äôs a sample of true product management at play: 
How good narrative is built, how consumer is engaged and eventually influenced 
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/opinion/coronavirus-trump-response.html
Output of a great product team
17/03/2020, 18:29 - Kumar Aakash: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:31 - Kumar Aakash: And on other hand is this ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ .. 

Shiping Great products is a DNA built up of elements of tasteful design, consumer behaviour insights, ability to influence consumer behaviour at scale and working with data
17/03/2020, 19:02 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Traffic is drastically down  in Bangalore, but, 60% ppl still going to office.
17/03/2020, 19:03 - Aayush: Jams are a step function
17/03/2020, 20:12 - Adam Walker: @917720020392 have you seen https://www.integromat.com/en/ ? it's a shockingly powerful no-code workflow automation tool
17/03/2020, 21:10 - +91 97571 63031: @919900707604 this looks interesting! How is it different than Zapier?
17/03/2020, 21:11 - Adam Walker: Way more hardcore.  the flow builder is more complex
17/03/2020, 21:12 - +91 97571 63031: Oh cool. Will test it out.
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Aayush: It‚Äôs not very different, but it‚Äôs more adaptive and economic.

This is already pretty famous btw.

Lots of people already use it.
17/03/2020, 21:23 - Adam Walker: I only just learned about it. It‚Äôs quite cool.
17/03/2020, 21:24 - Adam Walker: Also AutopilotHQ is an interesting alternative to Zapier as well. 
 Again. It can also handle much more complex workflows.
17/03/2020, 21:28 - Preetam Nath: Also https://parabola.io/
17/03/2020, 21:32 - +91 97571 63031: Is this good? Their website says

"If you can explain your problem to another person, you can teach Parabola to do it for you."

Thats one hell of a benchmark to set for an automation pipeline.
17/03/2020, 21:33 - Preetam Nath: Comes highly recommended by Makerpad folks. I trust them on all things no-code :)
17/03/2020, 21:33 - Preetam Nath: https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1197817699008753664?s=20
17/03/2020, 21:38 - Adam Walker: I found this to be a lot more tech heavy.
17/03/2020, 22:31 - Nazz: Yes. Used it a bit. Pretty popular among no-coders
17/03/2020, 23:21 - Aayush: That‚Äôs a pretty big thing to say, will definitely check this one out
18/03/2020, 00:23 - Nazz: Can't say if it satisfies that benchmark but it is quite good.
18/03/2020, 00:50 - Emmanuel: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 00:56 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Yeah, would love to know how Swiggy, Bigbasket etc are affected. I'd believe everything is sliding by about 30% but guys can tell more. 

How about Bounce, Yulu?
18/03/2020, 00:59 - +91 78480 44885: Bigbasket I am sure there must be atleast 20% uptick as people are stocking supplies. One other grocery startup I know had 20% uptick
18/03/2020, 00:59 - Jai Quickride: Bigbasket and Amazon have gone up. Just read an article. Not sure of the numbers
18/03/2020, 00:59 - Bosky: amazon claims via the ET article too, hiring 100k delivery folks it seems
18/03/2020, 01:38 - +91 99375 36453: What about Bigbasket daily?
18/03/2020, 01:38 - +91 99375 36453: Suprdaily, milkbasket, etc which are more on the daily subscription model
18/03/2020, 01:51 - +91 78480 44885: No idea about this
18/03/2020, 03:05 - Deepa Venkatraman: Any estimates on DAUs / total adult population for different states in India? Even a few states or national averages vs. other countries would be helpful.

18/03/2020, 11:47 - +91 99375 36453: That's just the delivery part. What about the restaurant? Kitchen? Chefs?
18/03/2020, 11:50 - Adam Walker: reads like a bomb disposal
18/03/2020, 11:51 - +91 99305 30939: I think Zomato too has introduced something
18/03/2020, 11:52 - +91 98861 70474: swiggy too
18/03/2020, 11:52 - +91 99375 36453: Dunzo too I guess

18/03/2020, 12:45 - +91 95600 44589: Those interested in this topic should read this book!

18/03/2020, 12:55 - +44 7774 406149: Thanks!
18/03/2020, 12:58 - Nazz: Someone I know did research on the same in India's north and south. Our crops shaped us. Wheat growing made northerners be more individualistic where as rice made southerners more collectivist. Of course, I am oversimplifying and she can explain better.
18/03/2020, 13:05 - Nazz: Btw. Nothing new in this. Been said for ages by Geert Hofstede, Fons Trompenaars, Edward Hall, Milton and Janet Bennett And, more recently by Darla Deardorf and some research by our own non profit AFS, our European counterpart EFIL and Italian counterpart Intercultura
18/03/2020, 13:05 - +91 99809 65477: Rice is the main crop in the east, northeast and even parts of J&K
18/03/2020, 13:06 - Nazz: I wonder many a times that why cultural dimensions are not so frequently discussed in Product Management.
18/03/2020, 13:06 - Nazz: Yes, she had some inferences on East as well but I can't remember exactly. I will ask for a paper if she has.
18/03/2020, 13:06 - +44 7774 406149: Rice va wheat idea is in there at the article. Though I am not sure of this north vs south divide.
18/03/2020, 13:07 - +91 99809 65477: Wow, that would be interesting. I wonder if it's more correlation than causation, though
18/03/2020, 13:08 - Nazz: Most research is üò¨
18/03/2020, 13:08 - +91 99809 65477: Intuitively I feel invasions and empires would have a greater impact than crops, but I could be wrong
18/03/2020, 13:10 - Nazz: True. The British empire has had a deep effect on the Indian understanding of wealth and beauty.
18/03/2020, 13:10 - +91 72591 76020: Language also does, there was a great Ted talk, but cant find it
18/03/2020, 13:13 - +91 99809 65477: Absolutely. It's perhaps the greatest factor.
18/03/2020, 13:13 - Nazz: Our education and policing systems are still nightmares of the British empire but maybe this is a discussion for the Public Policy fork.

The first name that comes to my mind is - Zoom
18/03/2020, 13:17 - Preetam Nath: Online gaming, streaming services, online education, home physical & mental well being, communication tools, pharma/biotech
18/03/2020, 13:18 - +91 72591 76020: Internet providers? :P
18/03/2020, 13:20 - Preetam Nath: Fresh grocery delivery, ready to eat foods, cooked foods? -- depends on which source people trust most to be hygenic and safe (ref: Domino's no contact campaign)
18/03/2020, 13:21 - Preetam Nath: Haha they are safe until Elon Musk covers the earth with tiny low orbit internet transmitting satellites
18/03/2020, 13:22 - Preetam Nath: Reason I'm interested in this, and posing this as a thought experiment to others -- if you had to startup today, what would you start

18/03/2020, 13:24 - Nazz: Anything entertainment
18/03/2020, 13:25 - Nazz: Even in an apocalypse with everything down, we would need entertainment (a Board game or carrom)
18/03/2020, 13:26 - +91 72591 76020: which is self produced as such

18/03/2020, 13:30 - +91 98861 70474: Side note: I wonder how long it will take for the likes of "Big Boss Covid-19 Lockdown" flavour etc. to begin airing. Pretty certain there's something like this in the works but I might be wrong.
18/03/2020, 13:30 - +91 99305 30939: Already happening

18/03/2020, 13:37 - Vikas: Thanks @917720020392 , Anyone interested to try and host Live Video discussions on mobile, ping me
18/03/2020, 13:38 - Vikas: Leher is new social media platform that focusses on having Video discussions in more social/causal context unlike online conferences
18/03/2020, 13:39 - Vikas: Self hosting, distribution on and off platform and creating a video profile of your thoughts and experiences on this social platform
18/03/2020, 13:41 - Vikas: Appreciate inputs on product and looking for help on gamification aspects. Do recommend who I can reach out to, including yourselves.
18/03/2020, 13:59 - Adam Walker: üëçgreat product everyone, FYI
18/03/2020, 14:00 - Suumit Shah Rankz: If you are running a fintech (especially lending) company, I've figured out a crazy workflow with some tech buddies on SEO that most fintech companies are missing out on. 

PS: Here is the recent organic ranking report for few of the keywords ;)
18/03/2020, 14:01 - Suumit Shah Rankz: <Media omitted>

18/03/2020, 14:05 - Adam Walker: yikes - that's India? that's expensive
18/03/2020, 14:05 - Suumit Shah Rankz: That's UK - even more expensive haha
18/03/2020, 14:06 - Suumit Shah Rankz: And those results are the output of 2 months ;)
18/03/2020, 14:08 - Adam Walker: right, I remember this
18/03/2020, 14:09 - +91 99305 30939: Would love to learn
18/03/2020, 14:28 - Vikas: Thanks Adam
18/03/2020, 14:53 - +91 99809 65477: Has anyone leveraged Facebook ads for a pure B2B funnel? Curious to know how it might play out.
18/03/2020, 14:57 - +91 99305 30939: I personally haven't done B2B.

But I'm guessing set-up a Facebook Pixel on website and do retargeting for visitors? Also, for people who've given email to download ebooks, signed up for webinars - can be retargeted via FB ads or even drip email campaigns
18/03/2020, 14:58 - +91 99305 30939: Though would definitely like to understand how others actually do it.
18/03/2020, 15:05 - +91 99809 65477: I've done both of these, though I'm thinking about cold ads. Explored cold emails pretty extensively too.
18/03/2020, 15:06 - +91 99809 65477: Heard that anyleads gives a decent number of personal email addresses from LinkedIn.


Perhaps someone has created a lookalike audience from an email scraper?
18/03/2020, 15:07 - +91 70328 02600: What specifically in B2B and which geography?
18/03/2020, 15:09 - +91 99809 65477: Thinking in generics, assuming they exist on online channels. Let's assume clients are BFSI in India
18/03/2020, 15:09 - +91 99809 65477: *target market
18/03/2020, 15:11 - +91 70328 02600: Ok. No fundaes on that. Some people have recommended me Facebook retargeting for people who download white paper/ visit site / did some action - but that was more for global SaaS
18/03/2020, 15:16 - +91 78287 80111: Any other channel to digitally target b2b?
18/03/2020, 15:21 - +91 72591 76020: Search Ads, LinkedIn, G2
18/03/2020, 15:26 - Nazz: This message was deleted
18/03/2020, 16:31 - +91 70328 02600: Can try Reddit ads also if you have active subreddits & global audience
18/03/2020, 16:32 - +91 72591 76020: and Twitter
18/03/2020, 16:32 - +91 70328 02600: How does one use G2 to acquire customers? Do they have ads?
18/03/2020, 16:33 - Nachi: I m getting good results through video ads too
18/03/2020, 16:33 - +91 72591 76020: I have not done it personally, but know others who did it
18/03/2020, 16:33 - +91 70328 02600: Aren't twitter ads very expensives? Whats typical CPC/CPM
18/03/2020, 16:34 - Nachi: The question is what persona are you targeting
18/03/2020, 16:35 - +91 72591 76020: It depends, I see a lot of ads. My needs (promoting content) it was expensive 

Largely the strategy should be: test, see what works, expand.. retest
18/03/2020, 16:35 - +91 72591 76020: And how much you are willing to spend, based on CAC and LTV
18/03/2020, 16:36 - +91 72591 76020: It works the other way too.. your budget and bandwidth define what you do and where :)
18/03/2020, 16:37 - +91 70328 02600: Fair enough. My initial experience with twitter ads was that its very costly. Was just curious if its working well for anyone :)
18/03/2020, 16:49 - Adam Walker: does anyone here use Clearbit Enrichment for Segment? How long did it take you to get access/set up? 

The annoying thing is that you can't self-upgrade and I'm presently waiting to hear back from their success team.

18/03/2020, 17:44 - +91 99809 65477: I built a Reddit bot to message everyone in a subreddit. The message has to be very carefully composed, though. Worked pretty well in 2017.
18/03/2020, 17:44 - +91 99809 65477: Anybody interested to try?
18/03/2020, 17:45 - +91 99809 65477: I tried LinkedIn ads at my previous org unsuccessfully. CAC was too high consistently. Others corroborated that.
18/03/2020, 17:47 - +91 70328 02600: Can I select if I want to send only to a few people? Don't want to spam the entire subreddit and invite their wrath
18/03/2020, 17:47 - +91 70328 02600: üòù

18/03/2020, 22:31 - +91 99020 11644: Couple of things they don‚Äôt consider

- treatment for cytokine storm in late stages
18/03/2020, 22:31 - +91 99020 11644: Reduction in spread due to heat or humidity (not verified - bad study at this point)

19/03/2020, 12:33 - Mriganka CapitalFloat: Could you give me more specific feedback on the ux that‚Äôs not working for you? I would love to pass it on to the requisite team
19/03/2020, 12:36 - +91 99162 67475: Cred knows by email scraping if the cc bill is paid

Both of them were not choices however this is the best time that they can announce such a thing and make the move seem possibly less controversial.

19/03/2020, 14:02 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Tldr?
19/03/2020, 14:06 - Aayush: Farming rice, because of the way the crop needs to grow, leads to collectivism also social comformity, where as farming wheat leads to individualism
19/03/2020, 14:14 - Pankaj Chauhan: More than eyes, it might create back problem or some problems you will not like to have - if you don't take break and walk around
19/03/2020, 14:14 - Ujjwal Trivedi: MP is individualist, Chhattisgarh is not. 
Doesn't fit my world view.  But interesting enough to get in to details
19/03/2020, 14:19 - Aayush: Need to know since how long they have been doing agriculture etc to come to that conclusion or border states or states doing both things would be tough to ascertain

Like Punjab today produces a lot of rice, not just wheat, but this wasn‚Äôt the case in history so is Punjab more individualist than Bengal? The answer seems to be yes.

So I guess geographical distance / distinctness of crop / exclusivity over long time period etc, would also be an important factor.
19/03/2020, 14:21 - Aayush: This message was deleted
19/03/2020, 14:21 - Aayush: The whole theory actually hinges on collective input to output ratio vs individualistic input to output ratio, this is the crux and that underlying thought perhaps holds more value than rice collectivism vs wheat individualism argument.
19/03/2020, 14:22 - Jasnoor Gill: Punjab's been doing tons of rice since early 70s thoü§î

What other trends have you guys seen? One thing I saw is conferences potentially moving online with startups like airmeet.

20/03/2020, 11:20 - Pallav Jhavar. PM: Good one @919769003072 some other top of mind thoughts - people becoming more health conscious in general, uptick in immune boosting supplement, on contactless,  voice becoming a big deal, solutions to help manage and monitor your parents health as you stay away from them
20/03/2020, 11:22 - +91 97690 03072: Thanks @917899740690 

Contactless & voice as a UX I did mention - totally agree on that.
Parents health - interesting point. Yea. 
Health consciousness / Immunoboosters - To be contrarian - I think people might be like 'yolo' this could've screwed us even if we were healthy etc. etc. So not sure if active everyday health consciousness will pan out that way.
20/03/2020, 11:24 - Pallav Jhavar. PM: Last point, agreed, it can go either ways, my guess is cult will start selling these supplements and juices soon enough üòÇ
20/03/2020, 11:24 - +91 97690 03072: Hahaha. People will sell for sure. üòõ üòÄ
20/03/2020, 11:33 - Pallav Jhavar. PM: Also better crowd management systems at airports, offices, aircrafts, hotels will start using better ACs which do more than just recycle the air, although not sure what kind of ACs they use now
20/03/2020, 11:36 - Mayank Berlin: What about insurance for Sr Citizens? It is nearly impossible for anyone above 65 to get coverage more than 2.5L even if they are willing to pay for it
20/03/2020, 11:37 - Mayank Berlin: Typically the default is to be covered under their childrens office insurance.
20/03/2020, 11:38 - Mayank Berlin: And 2.5L is probably a few days worth of coverage at a super speciality hospital for any major treatment
20/03/2020, 11:39 - Mayank Berlin: Surely there can be some better flow / products that can be built to handle this use case
20/03/2020, 11:40 - Mayank Berlin: Also don't get me started on the claims processing workflow ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
20/03/2020, 11:45 - Jasnoor Gill: I think there are dedicated senior insurance that are higher

20/03/2020, 20:13 - Nachi: my 2 lines: Leher has a lot of millenial and younger population. Using their platform and curated discussions, Leher enabled young people to share their questions, concerns, and opinions. This helped ease anxiety and enable spread of good information. Almost like an alternative media for young adults.

22/03/2020, 00:06 - +91 81118 10460: Now here is an interesting conspiracy theory if you want:
Impact of coronavirus on stock exchanges worldwide, within 1 month: 

 üá∫üá∏ -26%
 üá¨üáß -26%
 üá®üá¶ -25%
 üáßüá∑ -27%
 üá∑üá∫ -20%
 üá¶üá™ -19%
 üáøüá¶ -16%
 üá¶üá∫ -24%
 üáÆüá≥ -14%
 üá∏üá¨ -17%
 üá≠üá∞ -12%
 üá∞üá∑ - 17%

Now, look at this: 

 üá®üá≥ (China) + 0,3%

China, creator of the pandemic, has miraculously "recovered", has almost no more cases of coronavirus.  The world is now beginning to feel the effects and panic about the disease.  Who recovered first ??  China itself!  It seems to be that this virus was a move by the Chinese government in response to the loss of the trade war with the United States.  The goal: to throw the world into recession !!!

Is the scenario not clear?  They are already growing!  China bought almost everything it devalued on the stock exchanges around the world ... with that the Chinese became owners of the global companies that are in China and without the money leaving China.
 The Chinese president at Wuhan Hospital without muzzle ..
 China officially announces victory over the Corona virus

 Did the Chinese deceive the world with the Corona Virus?  And they saved their economy ?!

 This is what the Americans and Europeans think, after they sold their shares in high-value-added technology companies for a minimal price to the Chinese government.

 According to them, the Chinese leadership used an "economic tactic" that made everyone swallow the bait easily, before they asserted that China did not resort to implementing a high political strategy to get rid of European investors, in support of China's economy, which would bypass the US economy with this step ..!

 And because it teaches the science of certainty that Europeans and Americans are looking for excuses to slow and bankrupt the Chinese economy, China has sacrificed some hundreds of its citizens, instead of sacrificing an entire people ..!

 Through this tactic, China succeeded in "deceiving all", as it reaped about $ 20 billion in two days, and the Chinese president succeeded in deceiving the European Union and the United States of America in the eyes of the world, and played an economic game of a tactical nature, which was unthinkable.  !

 Before the Corona virus, most of the stocks and stakes in investment projects at "Technology and Chemicals" production plants were owned by European and American investors ..!

 This means that more than half of the profits from the light and heavy technological and chemical industries went to the hands of foreign investors, not to the Chinese treasury, which led to a decline in the Chinese currency, the yuan, .. and the Chinese central bank could not  To do something against the continuous fall of the yuan ..!

 There was even widespread news that China was unable to purchase masks to prevent the spread of the deadly virus.  These rumors and the Chinese President‚Äôs statements that he is ‚Äúnot ready to save the country from the virus‚Äù have led to a sharp drop in the purchase prices of shares of technology companies in China, and the empires of ‚Äúforeign‚Äù investors have raced to offer investment shares for sale at very low prices, and with attractive offers,  "Never seen before" in history ..!

 The Chinese government waited for foreign share prices to reach their "almost free" minimums, and then issued an order to purchase them.  And bought the shares of Americans and Europeans ..!

 And when European and American investment financiers realized that they had been deceived, it was too late, as the shares were in the hands of the Chinese government, which in this process nationalized most of the foreign companies erected on its soil in a near-free manner, without causing a political crisis or a single shot ..  !

 The same sources confirmed and pointed out that "Corona" is a "real" virus, but it is not a terrible danger that has been promoted across the world ..!

 China began to take out the anti-virus vaccine, this vaccine that it had owned from the beginning on the shelves of refrigerators after it had received its goal ..!

- One-strike policy on such forwards, second-strike will result in ban from group.

These are tough times. Please.

Tough times.
22/03/2020, 08:31 - +91 99020 11644: 1) To start with, China‚Äôs economy more than any other in the world is highly dependent on exports. And therefore a growing world economy. 
2) if it started it why would it sequence the virus so early and share with the world
3) jumping to conclusions based on no facts 
4) if china were to use biological warfare, better to start with something they already have the cure for
5) the Chinese stock market will tank again once the world economy is in recession. Looking at a stock market as a barometer underlying activity is irrational - markets themselves are driven by impulse and not facts

The post is very badly written, has a lot of random points, logical fallacies. But I'm trying to be open to the possibility that the post isn't hating on Chinese people _as much as highlighting_ the lengths the Chinese state can be go to. Even the badly worded, illogical attempts to highlight them out(the state apparatus, not the people) should not be absolutely silenced. Like how the Chinese state uses economic power to silence criticism of their genocidal campaigns, or their open human rights abuses. Or Yuval's recent note on using the crisis to permanently legitimise, deepen the state's open "under the skin" surveillance. 

Do I believe in any of the contents of this post - no. But everything said, perhaps @919820820663's irrelevance argument should prevail since this specifically is a products focussed group.

(sorry don't intend to stretch/restart the discussion.. would feel uneasy if I don't defend the right to _say anything_ although it is really difficult to defend the contents of the post) üôèüèΩ
22/03/2020, 14:31 - Jasnoor Gill: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ you have freedom of speech, doesn't mean you can force ppl to listen to you üôÑ or that every platform (including this moderated group) has to allow it
22/03/2020, 15:01 - Abhishek Tiwari: totally agreed with moderation of the post in this group in second last para üëÜüèΩ

Tried to highlight my fear of processes that can become authorities to label and quash "heretic opinions" - since i sincerely believe that homogenisation of thoughts can be dangerous in the long run.

Saying it again - the post isn't defensible, but their right to say anything _once_ is.. unless @918111810460 has a history of spamming the group with irrelevant posts. If it is so, removal can also be perhaps justified. üôèüèΩ

its an emotional band aid solution. But an advisory from Labour comes with strong bells and whistles. If you are politically connected, it doesnt matter much. but if you are the average joe business owner, they do crack down with a vendatta.

23/03/2020, 16:16 - +91 72591 76020: as in economically
23/03/2020, 16:16 - Nachi: absolutely.
23/03/2020, 16:16 - Nachi: if it doesnt naturally, US will make sure it does artificially
23/03/2020, 16:17 - Nachi: by that i mean, consumption will be low, and if US sees say china or japan doing well in terms of economy while they are tanking; they used to use soft power to create trade deals that tightly ties the economic growth. Now it will be straight up tariff.
23/03/2020, 16:18 - +91 72591 76020: while it is an opportunity for China for sure, what can India do to leverage it?¬†

More direct: where do we have the foundation to leverage the opportunity of coming out earlier than the US?
23/03/2020, 16:18 - Nachi: Love this question Ravi
23/03/2020, 16:19 - Nachi: i dont know
23/03/2020, 16:19 - Nachi: but would love to know the answers
23/03/2020, 16:19 - +91 72591 76020: same here :)
23/03/2020, 16:20 - +91 72591 76020: let's make it more specific ... in tech, what can we do? to get long term advantage?
23/03/2020, 16:20 - Nachi: my sense is Productvity growth and domestic prosperity. This is from a book by ray dalio and another from clay christnsen.
23/03/2020, 16:21 - Nachi: heres what i am thinking: 
Next 6 months are gonna be hard to sell, so make it easy for people to retain or buy. Focus on value creation through good productvity. People are gonna be willing to talk but not buy.
23/03/2020, 16:21 - +91 72591 76020: domestic prosperity is too hard to achieve in a global world. Today while most countries are lockign down people, cargo is not affected
23/03/2020, 16:21 - Nachi: why not use their feedback to build products so when the consumption does resume, we have one of the best in market.
23/03/2020, 16:21 - +91 72591 76020: +1
23/03/2020, 16:21 - +91 72591 76020: I guess folks will be more cost conscious for a while
23/03/2020, 16:22 - Nachi: domestic prosperity starts with little things from what i understand. Buy locally, source locally, dont stiff on tips and salaries
23/03/2020, 16:22 - Aayush: This is the goal anyway
23/03/2020, 16:23 - +91 72591 76020: True, but supply chains are global. Many countries will try to source medical stuff locally for sure
23/03/2020, 16:23 - Nachi: oh i was just commenting on what I can do
23/03/2020, 16:23 - Nachi: not a lot i can control wrt macro economics
23/03/2020, 16:23 - Nachi: those are cycles, and they tend to turn over periodically
23/03/2020, 16:23 - +91 72591 76020: True
23/03/2020, 16:24 - +91 72591 76020: I guess (rather hope) people will be more human to others
23/03/2020, 16:25 - +91 72591 76020: Productivity is another interesting topic .. and how it will get affected in the long run
23/03/2020, 16:25 - Nachi: i would suggest reading prosperity paradox
23/03/2020, 16:25 - Nachi: it challenges the age old top down economic development model
23/03/2020, 16:26 - Nachi: and really answers your question, how can we innovate ourselves into prosperity
23/03/2020, 16:26 - +91 72591 76020: speaking of reading... I fear physical books now :P
23/03/2020, 16:26 - +91 72591 76020: Will buy it on kindle
23/03/2020, 16:28 - Nachi: for this i love Ray Dalios thinking on productivity
23/03/2020, 20:04 - +91 88617 98719: Coronavirus impact: Suspend HD videos, COAI tells Netflix, Hotstar, other OTTs

23/03/2020, 20:17 - +91 97571 63031: Has overall internet bandwidth become a problem at all in India?
23/03/2020, 20:17 - +91 99020 11644: We‚Äôve noticed the zoom calls dying recently.
23/03/2020, 21:23 - Mayank Berlin: It's bound to happen. Demand spike across the board. Everyone is streaming (parents, kids etc), fb has noticeably started to stutter when refreshing,youtube is buffering since yesterday
23/03/2020, 21:35 - Jasnoor Gill: Could perhaps be local bandwidth issues etc? My Airtel fiber has been pretty consistent
23/03/2020, 21:36 - Jasnoor Gill: Many cable broadband guys etc under provision their actual internet connections, with day pipes to Google and Netflix possibly
23/03/2020, 21:36 - Jasnoor Gill: *fat pipes only to
23/03/2020, 21:38 - Mayank Berlin: Nah.. Checked with friends and colleagues across Delhi / noida. Everyone is seeing a bit of jittering
23/03/2020, 21:39 - Jasnoor Gill: Funny. Blr Airtel is decent. Getting consistent 300mbps on fiber
23/03/2020, 21:39 - Jasnoor Gill: Btw, if it's YouTube etc, could be local Google pipes straining under load instead :)
23/03/2020, 21:39 - Jasnoor Gill: Google offers free peering to big broadband guys iirc
23/03/2020, 21:40 - Jasnoor Gill: Those points could be overloaded
23/03/2020, 22:15 - +91 97571 63031: My experience too. We have an enterprise ACT connection and my network quality hasn't changed at all.
23/03/2020, 22:17 - Mayank Berlin: Hmm could be a function of a fatter pipe. Moar $ = Better service
24/03/2020, 07:09 - +91 99993 00413: Hey team ‚Äì do you guys know of any application or service that is being used (or can be applied) for tracing the recent locations and contacts of people infected with COVID-19 to help governments and individual constituents better understand¬†who is infected and who else has been exposed. I realize there are large privacy concerns here with sharing personal info on this, but JPC has been getting asked about ways in which our partners can help local communities combat this by limiting exposure¬†to others.
24/03/2020, 07:28 - Preetam Nath: Hey, anyone from Bigbasket here who can help get an order processed/delivered? This is for doctors staying at Gandhi who are surviving on Maggi and would literally starve if their mess closes today. 

Bigbasket order was scheduled for today but got cancelled due to excess demand. If cancellation is for all orders, I assume nothing can be done. If it's for selective orders, I'm hoping something can be done.

Kindly DM ASAP if anything can be done üôè
24/03/2020, 08:59 - Adam Walker: Hey @919008767748 have you tried Swiggy stores? It appears to be operating this morning.
24/03/2020, 09:13 - Preetam Nath: Yeah checked already. Found 2 supermarkets but none of the essential items that they need are available.

Thanks for the suggestion!
24/03/2020, 09:22 - +91 96866 56459: Let me try patching you to someone in BB
24/03/2020, 09:24 - +91 96866 56459: Also a possibility that it is not due to excessive demand - not sure if BB guys are being allowed to operate freely during 144, which was imposed midnight.
24/03/2020, 09:25 - +91 96866 56459: Also - hey - what happened to covidout.in? Was my place to get Covid data. Seems to be down since yesterday.
24/03/2020, 09:55 - Adam Walker: Is there a place where you can know what law is currently present where you are and what you can and cannot do from that law?
I'm unclear if the janta curfew is still operating, and whether there is 144 in Bangalore. 

Honestly, my question is - can I go out for a walk?
24/03/2020, 09:55 - +91 97426 08800: Try this https://covidindia.org/
24/03/2020, 10:00 - +91 98186 49039: Janta curfew wasn't really a curfew. But there is section 144 in bangalore as per news
24/03/2020, 10:00 - +91 98186 49039: Livemint: Coronavirus: Karnataka under lockdown, Section 144 in Bengaluru, Mangaluru.
https://www.livemint.com/news/india/coronavirus-karnataka-under-lockdown-section144-in-bengaluru-mangaluru-11584990923929.html
24/03/2020, 10:01 - +91 98186 49039: If you have a quarantine stamp, you may get arrested. Police are doing rounds I hear, atleast in my hometown in kerala , asking people outside on what their reason is for stepping out.
24/03/2020, 10:02 - Adam Walker: Ok. So it means stay indoors.
24/03/2020, 10:02 - Adam Walker: It wasn‚Äôt clear from the article?
24/03/2020, 10:04 - +91 98186 49039: Theoretically section 144 bans five people or more from gathering. Practically if you are out for  essentials , that should be okay. But yesterday there was mad rush at the grocery store and supermarket near my home, because of the impending announcement of 144
24/03/2020, 10:04 - Adam Walker: yeah
24/03/2020, 10:05 - Adam Walker: government seriously did not forecast this
24/03/2020, 10:08 - Adam Walker: does that mean you can go for walks?
24/03/2020, 10:08 - Adam Walker: That's what I'm unclear about. 
And every news article doesn't have a summary of the dos and don'ts.
24/03/2020, 10:08 - +91 99305 30939: I don't think you can
24/03/2020, 10:08 - Anivar Aravind: They do. that is F**king aadhaar based aepds
24/03/2020, 10:08 - +91 99305 30939: It's only for essential services for now
24/03/2020, 10:08 - +91 98186 49039: Haha. I don't know. If you don't step into the main road, you should be okay, coz the police will be patrolling the main roads
24/03/2020, 10:09 - +91 99305 30939: Britain is allowing people one walk/exercise/cycling outside per day but India hasn't made that exception
24/03/2020, 10:11 - Adam Walker: yeah, in the US people are going out to parks
24/03/2020, 10:11 - Adam Walker: I think people are going to go stir crazy.
24/03/2020, 10:12 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Too many to effectively manage exceptions, people will assume exceptions anyway
24/03/2020, 10:12 - Adam Walker: I get that ü§£
24/03/2020, 10:13 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Stupidity sees no borders. üòÅ
24/03/2020, 10:13 - Adam Walker: but it's a good thing to go out to parks
24/03/2020, 10:14 - Adam Walker: I think people need to get outside
24/03/2020, 10:14 - +91 99993 00413: US/UK are seeing thousands on new cases everyday
24/03/2020, 10:14 - +91 99993 00413: make do with balconies/terrace
24/03/2020, 10:15 - +91 99993 00413: India has an under testing, under reporting issue - and non compliance of quarantine stamps! :(
24/03/2020, 10:15 - +91 96866 56459: Thanks.

24/03/2020, 10:27 - Shuba Broadsheet: My understanding is that they do not want people out for walks on the roads. I too was unclear but on my running group they clearly said we are not allowed to run outside until the 31st.
24/03/2020, 10:28 - Adam Walker: Ok. Thanks Shuba.
24/03/2020, 10:29 - +91 98186 49039: Ah. :(
24/03/2020, 10:34 - +91 96866 56459: Hey man, we are struggling with the demand. Having a tough time retaining pickers and delivery boys. The cops are also pulling us back and behind bars in certain cases because we are out. We also have supplies. Need people to support the chain. Please bear with me while we work with authorities to fix this
24/03/2020, 10:35 - +91 96866 56459: From Tejas Vyas, Bigbasket.
24/03/2020, 10:35 - +91 96866 56459: This the reason @919008767748
24/03/2020, 10:35 - +91 99020 11644: We have heard the same thing from farmers
24/03/2020, 10:36 - +91 99020 11644: Entries into BLR are shut. My friend who runs a farm is not able to get her produce into the city
24/03/2020, 10:36 - +91 99020 11644: Apparently police is beating up anyone who tried to enter the city. Yesterday our Flipkart grocery warehouses had lots of missed deliveries from brands because implementation of ‚Äúbasics are allowed‚Äù is very deformed on the ground.
24/03/2020, 10:36 - +91 99020 11644: If someone has access to the police/govt folks, pls help with highlighting the situation
24/03/2020, 10:36 - Nikhil Kumar: Guys, I would appreciate it if we don't spam this group. I think what you are looking for is a social media platform to put out opinions, debate & chat about it. This isn't the right forum IMO and for some of us who are working this is so much distraction non-stop. They are many other groups around for getting generic COVID updates.
24/03/2020, 10:42 - Vijay Mygate: üëç
24/03/2020, 11:04 - Preetam Nath: Yup have seen the same. Swiggy Stores guy was on his to deliver, but police stopped him and asked him to go back. Back to square one.
24/03/2020, 11:10 - Yatin Shuttl: Anyone from mfine here?

01/04/2020, 00:47 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: I was actually hoping to rent these devices in 3-4 locations across the globe and get my classmates to come to those locations. Like BLR, Chennai, one location in Bay Area, etc. let me check out your list of applications :)
01/04/2020, 00:26 - Sai: This has always been the purported 'killer app' for VR

While Sansar is a start, there exist now about a dozen applications competing for the same type of use: https://is.gd/S98cxY (small list here). Facebook too, has been working on a whole new version of it's core social network mechanics in VR, in Horizon (oculus.com/facebookhorizon)

We have the whole line of Oculus devices (Rift, Go, Quest etc.) and the tech is nearly good enough for an enjoyable experience. The problem currently seems to be adoption of the tech. For the broader audience, VR tends to not have sticky enough use cases to warrant the friction of putting on the goggles, doing something, and then resuming things in the real world. This means basically there is nobody to play these shared multiplayer experiences with. 

Hopefully that changes in the near future. I can vouch for the fact that when you try a really good VR experience, it certainly makes an impact! ü•Ω
01/04/2020, 08:00 - +91 98999 75887: Anyone from Quikr here?
01/04/2020, 09:55 - Sankshep Swiggy: Folks, anyone from apnacomplex here?
01/04/2020, 10:44 - Adam Walker: Few folks including @919810273856 and @917008230661 have come up with  http://Worldv3.org to reimagine the new world from ground-up. they are looking for new ideas which will be shared with govt, startups and other stakeholders.
01/04/2020, 10:45 - Adam Walker: Online fitness, automated warehouses, films release only online etc.

01/04/2020, 10:58 - Praveen Inmobi: Hi folks - anyone here who has experience setting up Hubspot for MAP and Salesforce for CRM, with two way syncing between them. Wanted to pick your brains on challenges with respect to this integration and best practices
01/04/2020, 11:02 - +91 72591 76020: Admins can someone add Vivek Jaiswal, founder of Omoto. He is already there in our SaaS group (I invited him via the link). [‚Ä≠+91 7761844042‚Ä¨]
01/04/2020, 11:04 - +91 72591 76020: <Media omitted>
01/04/2020, 11:05 - +91 72591 76020: hoping it moves here :P
01/04/2020, 11:16 - Nachi: for booking.com those are the sum total of years of Coversion Optimization experiments and A/B tests
01/04/2020, 11:17 - Nachi: this is when experiments have taken over product strategy and vision
01/04/2020, 11:17 - +91 72591 76020: +1 . Short-term vs Long term
01/04/2020, 11:17 - +91 72591 76020: and also narrow your field of view w.r.t changes in the world
01/04/2020, 11:20 - Amit Singh: If nobody is here, please ping me. 
The founder is a good friend.
01/04/2020, 11:25 - +91 96112 56611: <Media omitted>
01/04/2020, 11:26 - Prashant Singh Paytm: can you share the link to hiring fork group
01/04/2020, 11:26 - Prashant Singh Paytm: ?
01/04/2020, 11:27 - Nachi: yeah, don norman and a few others behavior design folks have been srying about this. This could cause emotional fatigue like the last era had a design fatigue
01/04/2020, 11:27 - +91 96112 56611: Funny thing is - it becomes a industry standard :)
And then nothing else really matters because customers really don't have a choice. They'll not leave you because of predatory UX.
01/04/2020, 11:28 - Nachi: sadly, Yes. Which is used by the subsequent generation of product owners to argue doing the same
01/04/2020, 11:28 - Jasnoor Gill: Google. Multiple articles on all the nudges and fomo generation that travel sites do
01/04/2020, 11:28 - Amit Singh: They would. 
I switched from MMT to Cleartrip primarily for the UX.
01/04/2020, 11:28 - Jasnoor Gill: I went back due to discountsüòÅü§£
01/04/2020, 11:29 - Nachi: Amit singh-ji people like you represent 1-2%
01/04/2020, 11:30 - Ujjwal Trivedi: I can't get over easemytrip. Fastest way to book at almost cheapest price.
01/04/2020, 11:31 - Amit Singh: Switching costs are high for all categories of apps. 
But imagine the other side, would someone used to a Cleartrip every switch to an MMT?
With good UX you build a bigger moat, is what I'm saying. 
And 2% moving from competition to you is significant, isn't it.
01/04/2020, 11:31 - +91 96112 56611: In fact I feel for a established Flight booking website the moat can be really low - what different can you offer from your competitor if both of you are trustworthy enough.
01/04/2020, 11:31 - Nachi: travel is a game of conversion. Each person travels personally once or twice a year.
01/04/2020, 11:31 - Amit Singh: That said, I concede that Optimisation is eating CX for breakfast. 
Would love to learn from and participate in the discussion that follows.
01/04/2020, 11:31 - Nachi: so converting them at the time of intent is crucial
01/04/2020, 11:32 - +91 99809 65477: @919686656459 thoughts?
01/04/2020, 11:33 - Amit Singh: @919686656459 are you CT or MMT?
01/04/2020, 11:35 - +91 96866 56459: The entire conversation crunched up in one sentence. This is it. Wham!
01/04/2020, 11:38 - +91 96866 56459: But having said that, I do have thoughts on the short term, long term aspects of it. There is a perception that gets built up over time. Thoughts on CT and easemytrip above are examples. Good perceptions get you to the site of choice as the first browser tab action. Which is crucial .Esp for folks like us in this group. You then go to other choices (secondary searches / OTAs etc). And then the mechanism of - "ok it is 'just' Rs.50 more and I can afford it" etc, keep you back in the original tab.
01/04/2020, 11:38 - Nachi: they know that, if you look at booking.com universe
01/04/2020, 11:38 - Nachi: any new comer with a better product will get acquired by them
01/04/2020, 11:38 - Nachi: for e.g Kayak.com
01/04/2020, 11:39 - Nachi: since they have a $ advantage, this was possible
01/04/2020, 11:39 - Nachi: same with dating
01/04/2020, 11:39 - +91 96866 56459: Having seen the consumer facing side (led flights at goibibo earlier) and now doing b2b (saas for aviaton), I kinda know that the pricing difference (esp in the case of flights) is not more than that Rs.50-100 ~~ DGCA norms ~~ the stickiness is from internal points / wallets / cashbacks
01/04/2020, 11:40 - +91 96866 56459: Damn. Didnt know mark down applies here in whatsapp web too!! ~~ does a strike through. TIL!!
01/04/2020, 11:40 - +91 96866 56459: Yep. And the culture that they have built up for AB testing is impressive (same with Agoda).

01/04/2020, 11:42 - +91 81233 27117: Kayak for international flights, Skyscanner for rest of the flights. Booking.com for hotels and MMT (doubleblack) for personal travels (when i am sure trip cancellation is more or less written on my fate :P)
01/04/2020, 11:47 - Jasnoor Gill: No diners black holders here? 30% back if you are willing to live with their crap UX. Worth it ü§£
01/04/2020, 11:58 - Kumar Aakash: Booking CX has been stellar IMO. From their booking assistant to entire listing density, surfacing of relevant reviews, photographs ...just checked my own account ..have done over 150 transactions there! ..always found it a delight
01/04/2020, 11:58 - +91 98184 17804: MMT looks like the same booking.com. Different pods trying to optimize conversion
01/04/2020, 11:58 - Kumar Aakash: And form a conversion pov ..as a product person I think the product does its job better than any out there
01/04/2020, 12:13 - +91 72591 76020: Turns out the guy who started the thread is not on the main group. He is only there on the hiring one. Can the admins have a look, vet and add him .. Deeptam : +91 99031 50680

01/04/2020, 12:33 - +44 7774 406149: These UX interventions are famously called ‚Äúdark patterns‚Äù. Travel has one of the highest customer acquisition cost, so every travel site tries to over index on converting the customer who might not ever come back on the site. That is also the reason that travel industry keeps on consolidating. B.com is a different beast. As someone said before, they are more of a A/B test company than travel company and it works for them at their size. They don‚Äôt care about market share because Glenn Fogel makes sure that any shiny thing in travel, has either B.com written on it sooner than later or they are invested it. That‚Äôs why despite Ctrip and them having similar txn volume, they are valued at least 2x more on the exchange.
01/04/2020, 12:36 - +91 99031 50680: Hi All,

01/04/2020, 12:37 - Jai Quickride: Makes sense. So does Booking care about conversions to the extent of not caring about Retention, because I think Dark Patterns would not be liked by customers in general?
01/04/2020, 12:40 - Jai Quickride: Because I see OTAs like AirBnB on the other end with a significantly better CX, and not using any of these hacks. How do both of these compare with significantly different strategies, even though CAC would presumably be similar?
01/04/2020, 12:47 - +44 7774 406149: Dark Pattern as a concept has been labelled recently. People might not like Dark patterns but people might not even know that they don‚Äôt like dark patterns (behavioural science 101) Yes, there is a feeling of fomo and it pushed customers to the next step funnel but at the end when you feel that you have ended up with good deal. Retention is really high for B.com because that‚Äôs also a function of price and selection of inventory which is unmatched in the markets where it is a leader.
01/04/2020, 12:50 - +91 77618 44042: Hello folks! 

Great to connect here. Thanks @917259176020 for the shout-out üëçüèª

I am Founder & CEO at Omoto - a SaaS tool for customer experience measurement, monitoring, and management using NPS. 

Host of CX focussed podcast CX Conversations - have hosted CX head at MMT Group, linking back to the conv happening here üôÇ

Happy to connect over LinkedIn too üëçüèª
01/04/2020, 12:52 - +44 7774 406149: CX or UX? From perspective of CX, B.com is way better (has automated 80% of the cases you would ever need to call or email). CAC are not similar since Airbnb operates in a domain called ‚Äúalternate accommodation‚Äù A small part of B.com inventory is that, while other is independent and chain hotels
01/04/2020, 12:58 - +91 77618 44042: In CX convenience matters a great deal and booking is supremely convenient compared to any other OTA‚Äôs. But that degree of convenience changes from one customer cohort/segment to another. I may prefer chat solution on booking while someone else might like calling customer service better, for instance.

Overall - UX + convenience + inventory etc all add to overall CX. 

Booking that ways delivers a great UX on its site and app and overall CX is better with Booking at all touchpoints - if you finally land up speaking with a customer service agent at booking you‚Äôd really like their friendliness and care + proactiveness. 

All in all CX plays a major role in retention.
01/04/2020, 13:00 - +91 77618 44042: I donno what exactly was the thread of this discussion, but I can‚Äôt help it when I see a talk around CX üò¨

01/04/2020, 13:06 - +91 81118 10460: Curious to know what the group thinks on the level of pushiness for conversion at the time of showing intent.

Perhaps these may vary across industries, but still trying to gather your views:

(1) any understanding on which customer segment(s) have a better chance of conversion with push at the time of intent Vs. other segments? and 

(2) how penalizing customers thereafter, by default (travel prices increased by the airline or hotel) Vs. by design (Udemy increases prices of course if an order is not placed within 48 hours of sign up) impacts conversion of those who didn't convert at the time of intent
01/04/2020, 13:09 - Nazz: I think the original thread had an assumption that CX/UX = nice looking/cleanly laid out/minimalist/calming which is not always the case. It depends on target user, culture and intent. For example, look at most Chinese e-commerce apps. There is a lot of noise but that is how the culture shops.
01/04/2020, 13:12 - +91 77618 44042: Got it...thanks for clarifying @917720020392 üëçüèª
01/04/2020, 13:14 - +91 77618 44042: Here‚Äôs a conversation I had with Lizzie Chapman, CEO + Co-Founder at Zest Money about CX in FinTech.

01/04/2020, 14:14 - Arjun Malhotra: Sorry i missed this! My sense is a ton of inertia in general as people wait for uncertainty to subside. Funded startups won't struggle to survive 21 days but there's no sense of what the structural changes are like afterwards that affect their prospect ‚Äì and these will be pretty substantial.
Post Series-A VCs are triaging the portfolio to figure out where to allocate limited resources (time for talking about path to profit is over, it needs to be demonstrated for most startups now).
Good Series B & C outcomes would be raising capital to survive, even if at flat valuation. This will cascade backwards and I imagine minimum haircut to avg valuations for each round (which have inched upwards in the last 2 years) will be 30%.
Even well-funded startups are reducing 30%-35% in headcount and costs.
At seed, there may be a bit of inertia too but ‚Äì we're working on a new investment as of last Thursday ‚Äì so really can't say if it's business as usual for others

01/04/2020, 15:22 - +91 97409 80880: So curious to learn a bit and pick someone's mind on the subject, has anyone prioritsed features on a company based on a RICE model?

01/04/2020, 18:46 - +91 99978 63008: It directly connects to a dB like Mongo without the need for data transformation to a tabular format?

01/04/2020, 20:05 - Aayush: How many of you use Masterclass?

Any reviews?

Also, if anybody has some sort of an offer or discount code for Masterclass, it would be great.
01/04/2020, 20:06 - Nachi: i use, i bought it during the yearly offer
01/04/2020, 20:06 - Nachi: i like it for my non tech stuff things
01/04/2020, 20:07 - Nachi: like chess and poker
01/04/2020, 20:07 - Nachi: i would give it mixed reviews
01/04/2020, 20:07 - Nachi: its very fancy, and has vanity aalue
01/04/2020, 20:07 - Nachi: *value
01/04/2020, 20:09 - Nachi: you need to know basics before i could get value from them. like music production, i can't imagine anyone without prior knowledge getting value to actually implement
01/04/2020, 20:35 - +91 99020 11644: The cooking and writing classes are very good.
01/04/2020, 20:35 - +91 97418 25657: Tried a couple of courses. Felt very superficial in terms of knowledge.
01/04/2020, 20:36 - +91 99375 36453: @919916315081 :p
01/04/2020, 22:21 - Suhas Motwani PM: It truuu. But like @918778164531 shared, some a pretty good
I
01/04/2020, 22:29 - +91 88843 00220: Started last week. Only few classes done. Till now it‚Äôs been more of the thought process, approach & strategy sharing. Technical things haven‚Äôt started yet.
01/04/2020, 22:30 - Suhas Motwani PM: Which one are you doing?
01/04/2020, 22:30 - +91 88843 00220: Film making.
01/04/2020, 22:30 - Suhas Motwani PM: Nice
01/04/2020, 22:35 - Pankaj Chauhan: Technical things won't be there, it's only helpful if you know the basics of the craft, and ironically, it's most useful when you know the craft well, in my opinion classes there give you perspectives on different approaches, which are only helpful if you have the technical skills
01/04/2020, 22:37 - +91 88843 00220: Oh ok. Even though Perspective n Approaches are important, I was expecting to get more insights to technical side as well.
01/04/2020, 22:41 - Pankaj Chauhan: Yes, I also signed up for technical skills initially, it didn't help, then I learned technical skills through other mediums and visited the same classes again, and it was a surprise to see how valueable they are, new perspectives open up new doors in creative fields which is a need only when you have acquired technical skills and feel stuck in trying to get to next level
01/04/2020, 23:16 - Aayush: Looks like soft skills focussed in respective fields
01/04/2020, 23:17 - Aayush: Makes sense
01/04/2020, 23:17 - Aayush: Yeah I am clear that this isn‚Äôt not about technical stuff
02/04/2020, 09:31 - +91 86687 71511: Product leaders, I am running a fundraiser for pmcares fund to fight COVID19. I am providing product interview practice sessions for current or aspiring PMs in exchange for donations to pmcares fund.

02/04/2020, 12:18 - Nachi: Hello all, 
its me again. Organizing yet another masterclass this month. the speaker this time is Anuj Rathi, VP of product, revenue, and growth at Swiggy.  What would you like to ask him or learn from his experience and expertise? Kindly reply below or DM me, i can incorporate that in the session. :)
02/04/2020, 12:25 - +91 81233 27117: Do PMs at google optimize for Failure Metrics instead of Success Metrics or if sunsetting a product/feature the best thing to do?
02/04/2020, 12:25 - Nachi: its a end up company problem.
02/04/2020, 12:26 - Nachi: in fairly large organzations, Hustle is not rewarded as much as appearance of success. Sunsetting a product that hasnt grown in 3 quarters.
02/04/2020, 12:26 - Nachi: is a prudent thing
02/04/2020, 12:28 - +91 72591 76020: What some of us would give for 10M installs :)
02/04/2020, 12:29 - Nachi: haha but if you have a 2 billion reach already, then its like 5% of your TAM
02/04/2020, 12:29 - Nachi: i agree, it takes a dedicated team passionate abou the problem to take it past failure to success
02/04/2020, 12:30 - Nachi: that dedication and passion is rarely a trait big Cos hire for :P
02/04/2020, 12:32 - +91 72591 76020: lol :)
02/04/2020, 12:32 - +91 72591 76020: "past failure to success" need to note this down :)
02/04/2020, 12:33 - +91 72591 76020: Death by large numbers
02/04/2020, 12:50 - Jasnoor Gill: It's an opportunity cost for the company, could they invest those resources into a different place and make more is the question Google has to answer. Very different from a startup that might plod through so long as net positive for example
02/04/2020, 12:51 - Jasnoor Gill: Zynga had something similar in deciding to sunset projects. There's a certain % margin you have to hit, else I would rather move those resources to other higher margin projects for example
02/04/2020, 12:51 - Nachi: +1
02/04/2020, 12:53 - Aayush: Isn‚Äôt this how most companies decide?
02/04/2020, 12:54 - Nachi: depends. its not a one size fits all
02/04/2020, 12:54 - Nachi: for example, facebook doesnt do this.
02/04/2020, 12:54 - Nachi: they have a different way to measure ROI
02/04/2020, 12:54 - Nachi: and then there is the zuckerberg test
02/04/2020, 12:54 - Nachi: snap is the same way.
02/04/2020, 12:55 - Nachi: gaming companies work on tight margins, either its a hit or a fail. so they have tighter mechanisms
02/04/2020, 12:55 - Nachi: companies like atlassian or other similar enterprise products have another rubric
02/04/2020, 12:55 - Nachi: stickiness in the organization
02/04/2020, 12:55 - Nachi: you will be surprised how many crap products oracle and sap have that have not sunset yet
02/04/2020, 12:57 - Nachi: an EBITDA sensitive company will decide differently while a company who has free cash flow will play an offensive. They might invest in a loss making product purely as a power move to tweak perceptions.
02/04/2020, 12:57 - +91 72591 76020: Not all opportunities come with 3 commas , nor do opportunities explode a the beginning
02/04/2020, 12:57 - Nachi: Tez aka google pay is an interesting case study
02/04/2020, 12:57 - Aayush: Yes this is well understood
02/04/2020, 12:58 - Nachi: they defiend some long odds to build a valuable product
02/04/2020, 12:58 - Jasnoor Gill: Sure, but let's assume people who worked on the product inside Google have some additional info than we have here :)
02/04/2020, 12:59 - Jasnoor Gill: Either they didn't see market as being big enough, or not enough monetization perhaps ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
02/04/2020, 12:59 - Jasnoor Gill: All we can do is guess
02/04/2020, 12:59 - Aayush: But in the end there has to be frameworks for such decisions in medium to large orgs
02/04/2020, 12:59 - +91 72591 76020: Agree, but the counter is https://killedbygoogle.com/ :P :P :P
02/04/2020, 12:59 - Nachi: or we can find a good product leader and ask them :P
02/04/2020, 12:59 - +91 72591 76020: lol
02/04/2020, 12:59 - Jasnoor Gill: This ;)
02/04/2020, 12:59 - Nachi: this might make a good KT session @918105011844
02/04/2020, 13:00 - Aayush: They keep redoing products as well in other versions later if they deem fit?
02/04/2020, 13:00 - Nachi: simple answer is as Jasnoor said, its complicated
02/04/2020, 13:00 - Jasnoor Gill: I loved some of those products, but I imagine there were reasons Google did what they did, probably vision divergence or not enough growth/monetization whatever
02/04/2020, 13:00 - Nachi: from board mandate, to market reality, to ROI, to internal politics. lot of things factor into decisions
02/04/2020, 13:01 - Jasnoor Gill: This. Larger companies behave very differently than single product startups where it's sink and swim
02/04/2020, 13:01 - Nachi: if anyone wants to know about Google + story, lets chat over a chai online. Its a great case study of doomed to fail from the start.
02/04/2020, 13:03 - +91 72591 76020: I would be interested.. I for one had a similar idea before they started... really hoped it would work... basically we all lead many lives, thus we need different profiles.
02/04/2020, 13:03 - Nachi: acha, here is a teaser. Products often fail not because it was a bad idea, but because of bad execution
02/04/2020, 13:06 - +91 81233 27117: There was a giant twitter thread by a Product designer who worked on bringing Google+  to life, talking about what happened behind the scenes when making this product. Let me try and dig it up.

02/04/2020, 16:58 - +91 91080 14100: What do you want ? DM karo
02/04/2020, 17:00 - +91 99305 30939: 2008 all over again
02/04/2020, 17:13 - +91 91080 14100: So we graduated from Bschool in 2009
02/04/2020, 17:13 - +91 91080 14100: And had our first alum meet last year
02/04/2020, 17:14 - +91 91080 14100: Every year my batch meets, something has to happen :)
02/04/2020, 17:14 - Sankshep Swiggy: yeah I can relate
02/04/2020, 17:14 - Sankshep Swiggy: started with Lehman
02/04/2020, 17:36 - Aayush: Anybody from MyGate is here?
02/04/2020, 17:37 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: @919980309269
02/04/2020, 17:48 - +91 99020 11644: I went through this in 2001
02/04/2020, 17:50 - +44 7774 406149: Except this will last longer.
02/04/2020, 17:51 - Aayush: Thanks
02/04/2020, 17:52 - Aayush: There is an added problem that got progressively worse
02/04/2020, 17:52 - Aayush: Amount of loan money to be paid back for a good b-school degree
02/04/2020, 17:52 - Aayush: This is why this might hurt worse than it otherwise would have
02/04/2020, 17:53 - Aayush: Come to think of it, some schools will have terrible negative effect because of this
02/04/2020, 17:54 - Vikas: Not for long
02/04/2020, 17:55 - Aayush: The thing is this kind of an event does make people think more first principles
02/04/2020, 17:56 - Aayush: And it wasn‚Äôt as if even before this that wasn‚Äôt starting to happen
02/04/2020, 17:58 - Vikas: People have short memory. In good times, they are driven by greed, In bad by fear
02/04/2020, 17:59 - Aayush: Agreed but I am guessing some rationalisation with happen with course fees
02/04/2020, 17:59 - Aayush: Also good times not returning within next MBA cycle, current cycle will see issues
02/04/2020, 18:00 - Aayush: So at least 2 cycles will have a memory (just like older times), however the pain of these cycles may be higher amounting to higher loan amounts
02/04/2020, 18:01 - Aayush: What percent of people took education loan in 2000-01 / 2008-09 / 2020-21? What the average quantum?
What‚Äôs the ratio of monthly loan payout to salaries in these years?
02/04/2020, 18:06 - +91 99020 11644: It‚Äôs around 2.5x amount 2000-01 due to inflation and lower wages and availability of loans. 
I have the data somewhere
02/04/2020, 18:14 - +91 91080 14100: Education is recession proof no, as an industry
02/04/2020, 18:15 - +91 91080 14100: Lower the bar a little, demand shoots up multifold
02/04/2020, 18:16 - Aayush: Course fee vs median income vs loan taken vs interest vs inflation?

Good data if available

Question also is, is it better or worse this time in terms of economics? If worse the 2.5-3X will look a lot worse then it otherwise would have.
02/04/2020, 18:17 - Aayush: Agreed
02/04/2020, 18:52 - Pankaj Chauhan: Music production, music composition, writing, and as ironic as it may sound, best medium I found to get solid technical skills in all three were books
02/04/2020, 18:53 - Aayush: Which books where these @919930906960?
02/04/2020, 18:54 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Following
02/04/2020, 19:06 - Pankaj Chauhan: 1) Mixing Engineer's Handbook by Bobby Owsinksi - gives you solid understanding of the engineering and physics in music production and how technical concepts translate into perception of listener
2) Chord Chemistry and Modern Chord Progression by Ted Greene - although the name might suggest they are all about chords, which is true, but chords are the fundamental blocks to understand what music composition truly is, and these books teach precisely that
3) Story by Robert McKee - teaches you the technical framework of story telling, so much that it almost converts the art of storytelling into science
02/04/2020, 19:11 - Pankaj Chauhan: Please note that these are not easy reads at all, they are hardcore on technical skills, moreover these are starting points
02/04/2020, 19:14 - Jasnoor Gill: Took a loan in 09, knew things were bad going in, things will be fineü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
02/04/2020, 19:14 - Aayush: I have read the second book, it‚Äôs very nice, it was one the first theory books I had read on music back when I read it
02/04/2020, 19:22 - +91 77618 44042: Not ironic at all - anyone giving online courses is basically selling a funnel. 

Books are the best way to build solid knowledge on any subject. 

But most of us are looking for shortcuts, I guess ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
02/04/2020, 19:24 - +91 77618 44042: Guys, anyone has any idea about building web push notification using AWS service? I know FCM offers this on Firebase, but anything similar in AWS?
02/04/2020, 19:26 - +91 97418 25657: Why not a SaaS service?
02/04/2020, 19:27 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Danke. üôè
02/04/2020, 19:29 - +91 77618 44042: No specific reason, but I guess baking it into our SaaS app is better than using another SaaS service. No?

I am looking at sending app notifications to users.
02/04/2020, 19:32 - +91 97418 25657: Different browsers behave differently and they are constantly changing. Even notifications look different with various text limits and image dimensions. 

Plus you won‚Äôt get Analytics and segmentation capabilities out of the box.

You potentially will be reinventing the wheel with small stuff like scheduling your push campaigns.

PS: I run a web push company for e-commerce stores
02/04/2020, 19:34 - +91 77618 44042: Makes sense
02/04/2020, 19:34 - +91 77618 44042: Which company is this? Would love to check it out.
02/04/2020, 19:35 - +91 81233 27117: AWS Pinpoint & Simple Notification Service! Never really tried on a browser tho
02/04/2020, 19:35 - +91 77618 44042: These work for mobile push notification, as far as my research revealed

02/04/2020, 22:03 - +91 91080 14100: No offense, but why is Airtel at 5 ?
02/04/2020, 22:05 - +91 99162 67475: üòÄ yeah actually
02/04/2020, 22:06 - Siddharth Bangalore: ü§£üòÖ
02/04/2020, 22:14 - Preetam Nath: They said Thanks
02/04/2020, 23:04 - +91 93807 40700: Probably because their network in certain areas is really crappy AND internet speeds are super slow for a lot of users AND the customer service line has a user waiting for about 5 mins and then hangs up automatically, AND so the only way to log any complaints is through the app, as advised by their IVR.

Probably.
02/04/2020, 23:06 - +91 98186 49039: Cc @918800572779 - thoughts?
02/04/2020, 23:34 - +91 99809 65477: I think it's because they give Rs 50 off on any recharge through the app
03/04/2020, 08:14 - +91 96112 56611: not sure, may be subjective - often books may not convey "signal vs noise" as much as a video does. 
Case in point - golang content by william kennedy - its easy to gloss over a topic in his book but not in videos, you really understand the gravity of what he saying because he can express himself so well in a video (btw his brilliant course https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ultimate-go-programming/9780134757476/ - will make you fall in love with programming all over again)
03/04/2020, 08:27 - +91 96112 56611: Playstore ranking doesn't differentiate between organic and paid downloads. You can  increase organic downloads by spending $$ on paid downloads in lean times

03/04/2020, 10:19 - +91 97690 03072: Maybe the viral load becoming too 'diluted' if mixed with other samples?
03/04/2020, 11:27 - Anuj Gupta: This is a really clever idea! It could be highly effective in developed countries where the goal is to test the entire population and isolate the cases - possibly even repeat the exercise after a month or so. For a country like India where the poor cannot afford to just sit down and do nothing, this might not be a useful strategy - not to mention the near-impossibility of testing the entire population in the first place.
03/04/2020, 11:28 - +91 97690 03072: Reminds me of that interview quiz question: 100 bottles of wine. One has poison. How do you find it etc. least no of tries to get to the right now.

03/04/2020, 12:56 - +91 96633 75213: Based on last payment sms, I'm guessing. Anyone who swipes a credit or debit card.
03/04/2020, 12:57 - +91 99305 30939: Because we get location whenever we get a financial SMS.
03/04/2020, 12:57 - +91 99305 30939: That's how Walnut's ATMwithCash location tracker worked during Demonetisation

03/04/2020, 17:58 - +91 99305 30939: 90% of numbers in India are prepaid. With shops closed and movement not allowed, most prepaid numbers would run out of validity/recharge balance as most people don't know how to do online recharges.
03/04/2020, 17:58 - +91 99305 30939: So Airtel is allowing users to download Airtel thanks app, and do recharge for others, and get 4% commission (same as any normal retailer)
03/04/2020, 17:59 - +91 99305 30939: After Bharti Airtel, BSNL also extends validity of prepaid SIMs till 20 April - https://www.livemint.com/news/india/after-bharti-airtel-bsnl-also-extends-validity-of-prepaid-sims-till-20-april-11585637467716.html     Download mint app for latest in Business News - https://bit.ly/32XEfFE

03/04/2020, 18:05 - +91 99305 30939: This will be bigger in India in my view.. 90% market is still prepaid.. of which most recharge in physical outlets (which is getting tougher by the day) and can't do online.. as a result SIMs will go inactive as long as this lockdown thing continues.. hopefully temporarily
03/04/2020, 18:05 - +91 99305 30939: This is what an ex-Vodafone friend had said to me on above link.
03/04/2020, 18:14 - Aayush: Won‚Äôt happen
03/04/2020, 18:15 - Aayush: India‚Äôs telco numbers which will go down will only be secondary and tertiary sims (if at all)
03/04/2020, 18:15 - Aayush: Primary sims will be kept largely in tact
03/04/2020, 18:18 - Aayush: India‚Äôs telcos (minus Vodafone+Idea) might, in all probability, end up becoming stronger financially after the crisis
03/04/2020, 18:18 - Aayush: However telco plans would change after this in order to segment customers in different value clusters
03/04/2020, 18:30 - +91 97525 87946: Hi folks, any suggestion for GUI based MySQL management tool,

Question to the group:

Under what circumstances would you guys be willing to sit in a theatre or flight or take a metro or local train again?

Assume no vaccine which is 24 months away.
04/04/2020, 10:50 - +91 72591 76020: A flight may be, Metro no, Theater: I learned to make my own popcorn
04/04/2020, 10:52 - +91 72591 76020: Another interesting conversation : https://twitter.com/SarkarMania/status/1246040340299165697

most replies are stating they will reduce online purchases
04/04/2020, 10:53 - +91 99305 30939: Most airlines, malls and theatres would be bankrupt then. If you're taking an airline out of desperation, then it won't be viable.
04/04/2020, 10:53 - +91 72591 76020: It will be desperation travel
04/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 99305 30939: What happens to ticket prices then?
04/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 88617 98719: How did China manage with low stimulus and low medium strictness !!
04/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 72591 76020: Also what happens (already happeneing in US) when you know warehouse workers are infected / are not safe
04/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 72591 76020: really don't know.. they will be expensive ... but i will be really desperate
04/04/2020, 10:55 - +91 72591 76020: else i won't
04/04/2020, 10:55 - +91 99305 30939: This is true but would only work for home delivery categories

04/04/2020, 10:58 - +91 99305 30939: But what if you have zero cases in your local district for 3 months. Not even then?
04/04/2020, 10:59 - +91 72591 76020: At that time .. I say Test test test (right now I am against all-out testing, as it is a finite resource)
04/04/2020, 11:00 - +91 99020 11644: After I recover from COVID I plan to travel a lot.

04/04/2020, 11:01 - +91 99020 11644: No you can‚Äôt be immune and a carrier

04/04/2020, 11:02 - +91 99020 11644: It basically means your viral load is zero and you have antibodies.
04/04/2020, 11:02 - +91 72591 76020: let me rephrase.. transmittier ... like Bee + pollen
04/04/2020, 11:02 - +91 99305 30939: UK is working on immunity passport idea
04/04/2020, 11:02 - +91 99020 11644: No.
04/04/2020, 11:02 - +91 99020 11644: Not possible.
04/04/2020, 11:02 - Jasnoor Gill: ü§î
Once you are immune, you can't spread it
04/04/2020, 11:03 - Jasnoor Gill: I think you are confusing with asymptomatic maybe?
04/04/2020, 11:03 - +91 72591 76020: if you can move a box, you can move the virus
04/04/2020, 11:03 - +91 72591 76020: I am using that line of thinking
04/04/2020, 11:03 - +91 72591 76020: not internally.. but externally
04/04/2020, 11:03 - +91 99020 11644: But - no one knows how long immunity lasts for covid. For a lot of viruses the human body needs a booster of vaccines.
04/04/2020, 11:04 - +91 99305 30939: "Antibody (or serological) tests work on blood samples to detect the immunity conferred by past infection. The test kits use proteins from the virus as ‚Äúglue‚Äù to trap antibodies present in blood, said Eleanor Riley, professor of immunology at the University of Edinburgh.¬†

A finger prick should provide enough blood to detect two types of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2. The first, IgM antibodies, are shortlived and may indicate that the virus is still present. They usually disappear a couple of weeks after infection. In their place emerge a second more durable type, IgG antibodies. No one knows yet how long these will last and provide resistance to reinfection ‚Äî anything from a few months to a few years seems possible."
04/04/2020, 11:04 - +91 99305 30939: https://www.ft.com/content/0faf8e7a-d966-44a5-b4ee-8213841da688
04/04/2020, 11:04 - +91 99305 30939: Yes this is completely unknown presently
04/04/2020, 11:04 - +91 99020 11644: That is correct. No one knows how long immunity lasts. But it will last several months.
04/04/2020, 11:25 - Mayank Berlin: Has anyone checked about the precision and recall of the tests? What are the false positive rates?
04/04/2020, 12:38 - +91 99305 30939: "The PCR test is extremely accurate when carried out carefully by experienced technicians in a well-equipped lab. Because it specifically detects genes found only in the Sars-CoV-2 virus, it will produce very few false positives, said Andrew Preston, reader in microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath. 

False negatives ‚Äî which indicate wrongly that someone is clear of infection ‚Äî are more of a problem. They often result from problems with collecting and processing patient samples. For other viruses, false negative rates of 10 per cent are widely accepted and they can reach as high as 30 per cent. Therefore PCR tests ‚Äúhave more often been used to confirm an infection rather than give someone the all clear‚Äù, said Dr Gill at Warwick Medical School."

(50% of people kept switching rooms to interact with new folks. 
The barrier to approaching new people in a physical event is high. 
If you are not an extrovert, you can only hope for someone to come and initiate a conversation with you. 
Airmeet's networking lounge has significantly lowered this barrier.) -@919886314456

06/04/2020, 21:39 - Aayush: Swiggy Super has been stopped by Swiggy
06/04/2020, 21:40 - Aayush: Very interesting move if longterm
06/04/2020, 21:41 - Aayush: Will have enough positive and negative repercussions because of it
06/04/2020, 21:42 - Preetam Nath: What's the positives?
06/04/2020, 21:47 - Aayush: Industry water level rises, lesser barriers to entry
06/04/2020, 21:48 - Preetam Nath: Lesser barrier to entry assumes someone else can build a network of 10s of thousands of delivery folks and venues?
06/04/2020, 21:50 - Jasnoor Gill: Probably lack of delivery guys/lack of open stores etc?
06/04/2020, 21:52 - Preetam Nath: Super is the subscription fee feature if I'm not mistaken
06/04/2020, 21:53 - Jasnoor Gill: Ah, okü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ my nad
06/04/2020, 21:53 - Aayush: Yes
06/04/2020, 21:53 - Aayush: This is what‚Äôs leading to the discussion to some extent for sure
06/04/2020, 21:53 - Aayush: This message was deleted
06/04/2020, 21:54 - Aayush: Point being you don‚Äôt need 10s of thousands
06/04/2020, 21:55 - Aayush: Hyperlocal delivery systems need density per certain local neighbourhood area
06/04/2020, 21:56 - Preetam Nath: Agreed. We're you perchance referring to Swiggy Stores?
06/04/2020, 21:57 - Preetam Nath: Were* üôÑ autocorrect
06/04/2020, 22:00 - Aayush: Anything, including Swiggy stores.
06/04/2020, 22:17 - +91 98186 49039: Wait, what is being stopped? Swiggy super? or Swiggy stores?
06/04/2020, 22:18 - Aamna Khan: Can Swiggy PMs confirm if Super is discontinued? Would love to hear the rationale. I've been a loyal subscriber until recently
06/04/2020, 22:18 - Aamna Khan: Stores is still visible on the app. Don't think it's discontinued
06/04/2020, 22:18 - Aayush: No no
06/04/2020, 22:18 - Aayush: It‚Äôs not stores
06/04/2020, 22:19 - Aayush: Super is a delivery discounting subscription product within Swiggy
06/04/2020, 22:21 - +91 98186 49039: Yeap, got confused by the discussion, I'm  sure atleast half of the folks in this group are subscribers to it
06/04/2020, 22:22 - +91 99870 94433: Yeah it's not letting me renew. Gonna miss free delivery
06/04/2020, 22:22 - Aayush: Should be 70% plus in this group, esp in Bangalore.
06/04/2020, 22:22 - Preetam Nath: Yeah! Was painful to pay for delivery, Swiggy Super was the painkiller
06/04/2020, 22:23 - +91 98186 49039: Would love to hear this. Is it because the success metric has been achieved and now it's naturally  being sunset, or is it because the success metric was not achieved?
06/04/2020, 22:23 - +91 98186 49039: I was being extra conservative :D
06/04/2020, 22:24 - Aayush: You need to conservative here
06/04/2020, 22:37 - Aayush: Actually we should also ask people from other Startups but in similar fields what they think of it.
06/04/2020, 22:37 - Aayush: Anyone from Zomato?
06/04/2020, 22:38 - +91 97690 03072: @919654663685
06/04/2020, 22:38 - Aayush: Like food and grocery and hyperlocal stores
06/04/2020, 22:50 - +91 99019 89399: I think this might be a temporary move looking at the lockdown situation. Delivery workforce is scarce and startups/companies are already paying higher for ensuring supply. (‚Çπ10-‚Çπ20 higher per delivery)
So shelling out more discount at this time will not make sense for them.

07/04/2020, 19:48 - +91 96866 27129: Actually SoftBank ought to get sued
07/04/2020, 19:49 - +91 96866 27129: Even though it‚Äôs crazy they already more than 60% of WeWork if I‚Äôm not mistaken
07/04/2020, 19:51 - +91 98202 32612: This message was deleted
07/04/2020, 19:52 - +91 98202 32612: But theyve kept management independent - otherwise wework would have to reflect on Softbank Groups' balance sheet. And they dont want that
07/04/2020, 19:53 - +91 96866 27129: I thought they‚Äôll own 80 if they put in 3 billion
07/04/2020, 19:54 - +91 98202 32612: Ah maybe
07/04/2020, 19:58 - Aayush: So?

07/04/2020, 23:02 - Nachi: just a quick update for the group: 
I evaluated MSG91, TextLocal, Kaleyra Hexa. I finally went with HEXA by Kalera. I found Hexa better as it worked like a charm, great support, onboarding, and simple setup. they had a Covid-19 response special. I found them to also be cheaper overall. 

Shoutout to @919380740700  for helping with this.
07/04/2020, 23:02 - Aayush: You found Hexa better than TextLocal? Interesting need to check it out.
07/04/2020, 23:03 - Kumar Aakash: ^^
07/04/2020, 23:04 - Nachi: between textlocal and hexa, i found hexa to be half the cost. I think TL came to about 25-30 paise/sms. Hexa was 17-20 paise/sms.
07/04/2020, 23:04 - Aayush: Wow those are verycostly numbers for both btw
07/04/2020, 23:05 - Aayush: Or may be my pricing is dated
07/04/2020, 23:05 - Aayush: Used to be 10p-ish till April 2019
07/04/2020, 23:17 - +91 94563 18713: <Media omitted>
07/04/2020, 23:18 - +91 94563 18713: Sharing with the hope that it might help a few of us in upcoming product decisions.
07/04/2020, 23:19 - +91 99020 11644: They‚Äôve completely missed the mark. Predicting gdp growth of 3% in the worst case. They don‚Äôt realize India is going into recession this year. 
There are very few sectors of the economy which are going to be higher than last year.

08/04/2020, 00:34 - Adam Walker: Thanks for sharing this!
08/04/2020, 00:35 - +91 82961 49041: Yeah Super is temporarily discontinued. There were fewer restaurants for the customers to choose from due to COVID and also the ecnomoics not working well for Swiggy
08/04/2020, 00:44 - Aayush: Economics not working well in general for super or specific to Covid situation?
08/04/2020, 00:46 - +91 82961 49041: Specifically during COVID. Otherwise swiggy cannot afford to mess with Super considering its a hit among the loyal/ high-value customers
08/04/2020, 00:47 - Aayush: Yes, fair
08/04/2020, 00:49 - +91 82961 49041: Btw, would your propensity to order decrease without Super? Question to the group in general
08/04/2020, 00:51 - +91 99870 94433: Can't say
08/04/2020, 00:52 - Aayush: Absolutely
08/04/2020, 00:53 - +91 99809 65477: Well, I've used super when I used to order almost exclusively from Swiggy and I  do feel a tinge of negativity if I have to pay for something that's usually free.
08/04/2020, 00:53 - Aayush: And switch to Zomato / Own App / Other things
08/04/2020, 00:53 - Aayush: <Media omitted>
08/04/2020, 00:55 - Aayush: Mostly because you people have enabled the habit of not seeing the charges, now if you suddenly enable all of it, it‚Äôs going to produce some backlash for sure, reverting some folks to alternate methods or go back to old ways or even find new ways
08/04/2020, 00:57 - +91 82961 49041: got it.. there's definitely some perception at play here
08/04/2020, 00:59 - +91 82961 49041: but would you also be willing to pay if Super costed extra (say 50% or 100%) in the name of passing on this benefit to DEs or restaurants
08/04/2020, 01:00 - Aayush: This is what is suppose to happen, regardless of passing.

Unlike Uber pass, Super is a different product, it needs to priced much higher and should have much better benefits.
08/04/2020, 01:00 - Aayush: What‚Äôs the Super to Non-Super percentage in Bangalore?
08/04/2020, 01:02 - Aayush: And yes if it‚Äôs gets passed on 50% each to restaurant and rider, then the user also get better service and more product assortment, given there is a positive incentive to operate in hard times for everyone
08/04/2020, 01:04 - +91 99870 94433: What is super currently priced at?
08/04/2020, 06:26 - +91 77618 44042: Kailash is a great guy. Had hosted him on my podcast earlier. He talks a bunch about how product and engineering can build for CX.

08/04/2020, 06:34 - +91 93807 40700: Glad to help @918778164531 :)
And thank you for the positive feedback!
08/04/2020, 07:32 - +91 98999 75887: Same here. We have had a great experience with Kaleyra. Really easy to get started, easy integration with Zapier and Webhooks.

And of course, I am little biased coz Bhavya also got us some free credits for our COVID related project üòä

08/04/2020, 10:38 - Gokul Crisp: COVID could well be a long term inflection point for online grocery like how demonetization was for digital payments. :)
08/04/2020, 11:01 - +91 99020 11644: Possibly for remote work
08/04/2020, 11:01 - +91 99020 11644: As well
08/04/2020, 13:08 - Anuj Gupta: In my case, it increases my propensity to order. In absence of knowledge of how much DEs are paid, free deliveries feel like there is a greater chance of them being underpaid, which makes me want to order from Zomato which (at face value) seems to treat them better.
08/04/2020, 14:19 - +91 81233 27117: Was the face value largely influenced by the tipping feature and the bio's that they show?
08/04/2020, 14:29 - +91 93807 40700: üôåüèº Glad to hear it, @917004612001

08/04/2020, 14:30 - +91 93807 40700: Jeez autocorrect. Sorry
08/04/2020, 14:31 - Anuj Gupta: In the fee breakdown, below Delivery Charge it says "This charge goes towards paying your Zomato Valet" which gives me a rough idea of how much they might be getting paid. The two features you mentioned contribute more towards cultivating empathy towards DEs. The tipping feature gives me some control over their compensation as well.

08/04/2020, 14:35 - +91 81233 27117: Got it!
08/04/2020, 14:38 - +91 82961 49041: makes sense
08/04/2020, 14:38 - +91 82961 49041: its 129 per month and 349 for 3 months
08/04/2020, 14:41 - +91 99870 94433: Yeah I can see why it could do with a price increase.

08/04/2020, 16:03 - +91 97690 03072: Open sourcing which part? The list - mixed feelings - see the twitter thread - have put up a poll also
08/04/2020, 16:04 - +91 97690 03072: More people are recommending to not make this public - the database so to speak
08/04/2020, 16:04 - Suhas Motwani PM: Just the opportunities available bit, not candidate data
08/04/2020, 16:10 - +91 97690 03072: Not doing specific opportunities as much as overall companies. 
Yea - that can be made public, sure.

08/04/2020, 16:20 - Aayush: Should we rather make a hiring biased list and then float that list around and let prospective employees reach out?
08/04/2020, 16:21 - +91 97690 03072: Companies hiring also have too much information overload in that case, imo. I think skimming through a list of candidates - seeing who might work where, potentially works out better.
08/04/2020, 16:21 - Kumar Rangarajan: We just migrated fully to WF for our site. Let me know if you need any help. I can connect to my designer if needed
08/04/2020, 16:21 - Aayush: In an ideal world, yes
08/04/2020, 16:21 - +91 97690 03072: I run a monthly newsletter where I share a few curated candidates with a set of founders (portfolio and otherwise) - been doing that for over a year now - is received quite well, tbh.
08/04/2020, 16:22 - Aayush: We would have all gained more if there was one list
08/04/2020, 16:22 - Aayush: There are so many lists now
08/04/2020, 16:22 - Suhas Motwani PM: Exacttlyy^
08/04/2020, 16:22 - Aayush: How many lists will employees fill?
08/04/2020, 16:22 - Aayush: So point pe aao na? Why meander? Haha
08/04/2020, 16:23 - +91 95609 85630: For me, order propensity doesn‚Äôt decrease (short term, I understand the situation).

For my neighbors (using Zomato), they‚Äôve been tipping the delivery person in the range of 20 to 100 rupees just as good will (temporary behaviour in my opinion)
08/04/2020, 16:23 - Suhas Motwani PM: Aggy would've thought through this :P
08/04/2020, 16:23 - Aayush: Everyone has a list now or will have one, how will things consolidate? May be if list makers come together, possible I think but would need work. It would end up helping everybody much better.
08/04/2020, 16:24 - +91 97690 03072: Has asked a few people - hadn't seen a list going around - so put one togethter. 
Prayot had one list with 600 - he's sending that to us and we're adding it all here.
08/04/2020, 16:24 - +91 97690 03072: Any other lists you know of where people (candidates) have filled up from their end?
08/04/2020, 16:24 - +91 97690 03072: Agree on it ideally being in one place - utopian - but will try get as close to it as possibe
08/04/2020, 16:24 - Suhas Motwani PM: Aabhash had one that went around quite a bit
08/04/2020, 16:25 - Aayush: The largest must be Aabhash from Springrecruit
08/04/2020, 16:25 - Suhas Motwani PM: Cutshort folks too

08/04/2020, 16:27 - Aayush: Too international?
08/04/2020, 16:31 - Suhas Motwani PM: Lot of indian companies they are tracking - https://www.careervscovid19.com/insights
08/04/2020, 16:33 - Aayush: Is there a twitter handle list + LinkedIn profile list of people hiring for India? Or can we crowdsource one? And then just do one single tweet to connect them, unless they have some other issues?
08/04/2020, 16:33 - +91 97690 03072: Somewhat mixed feelings about companies in the recruitment space itself doing this. 
Of course - get that they're well placed to. But can't help see parts of it as salesy, somewhere. :-S 

Not to undermine / take away that its being super helpful, of course.
08/04/2020, 16:34 - Aayush: Who isn‚Äôt salesy on social media?
08/04/2020, 16:34 - Aayush: When everything is PR, everything is therefore PR
08/04/2020, 16:35 - Aayush: Nobody doing this is doing this without an incentive, however the incentive itself helps everyone because it makes more jobs happen amidst an economic crisis
08/04/2020, 16:42 - +91 97690 03072: Hahaa. Sure. I guess that's one way to look at it. :)

08/04/2020, 22:15 - +49 1525 5454000: Yes.... the impact and ripple effects might be big. Even in India was unemployment would be ~28% as the mostly it's with daily wage workers.

Certain that it will fall, the question is when n with what magnitude of economic losses

09/04/2020, 14:19 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Whats the issue with GoDaddy?
09/04/2020, 14:19 - +91 70328 02600: Costlier
09/04/2020, 14:20 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Haha! Everyone has almost same costs trust me - they will make money by selling add ons like hosting, website designer etc
09/04/2020, 14:20 - +91 70328 02600: Namecheap seems cheaper
09/04/2020, 14:20 - +91 70328 02600: i don't want hosting etc
09/04/2020, 14:20 - +91 70328 02600: just a domain
09/04/2020, 14:22 - +91 70328 02600: Is namecheap ok, if I just need a domain?
09/04/2020, 14:22 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Yup
09/04/2020, 14:22 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Namecheap is good too

09/04/2020, 14:22 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Or you can directly go for Google domains!
09/04/2020, 14:24 - +91 70328 02600: whats that?
09/04/2020, 14:24 - Suumit Shah Rankz: https://domains.google/intl/en_in/

09/04/2020, 14:25 - +91 70328 02600: They are costlier for the domain i am looking at
09/04/2020, 14:25 - +91 70328 02600: Yes, their renwal fee is higher generally
09/04/2020, 14:25 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Well yeah - 100/200 rupees difference probably
09/04/2020, 14:25 - +91 70328 02600: nop 1.5K
09/04/2020, 14:25 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Oh what! Crazy
09/04/2020, 14:39 - Mitalee: I've been on namecheap for 2 years, very hassle-free
09/04/2020, 14:40 - +91 81233 27117: DNSimple and Gandi.net
09/04/2020, 14:40 - +91 70328 02600: cool
09/04/2020, 14:43 - +91 81233 27117: When buying domains on Godaddy use Incognito always, never ever renew with them (they recover the discounts from year 1 in year 2) and finally their support/sales simply sucks.
09/04/2020, 14:47 - +91 70328 02600: If I have the domain with godaddy, I need to renew with them only right? Is there any alternative?
09/04/2020, 14:49 - +91 81233 27117: There is no lock in that you have to renew with them, you can go to any registrar and transfer your domain. Also Renewal Fees =! Price of a new domain always.
09/04/2020, 14:50 - +91 70328 02600: transferring domain also costs. For example google domain charges INR 860 to transfer a domain from godaddy
09/04/2020, 14:51 - +91 81233 27117: Transferring Cost included the cost of domain as well. So 860 will essentially be the renewal cost (for year) + the transfer.
09/04/2020, 14:52 - +91 70328 02600: ok. got it
09/04/2020, 16:33 - +91 96546 67741: Hi, is anyone using a sales analytics tool at their org? Would love to hear suggestions for good tested tools out there.
09/04/2020, 16:42 - +91 93807 40700: Sales analytics is a pretty large umbrella... Any specific metrics you are looking to measure?
09/04/2020, 16:43 - +91 96546 67741: Analysing sales calls, giving personalised recommendations on top of it
09/04/2020, 16:43 - +91 96546 67741: preferable for an inside sales setup

09/04/2020, 20:25 - +91 99809 65477: I recorded every call on HubSpot, plated some back and gave personal critique. Alternatively, you could use some sort of text to speech to same time. Recording the call is essential in my opinion.

09/04/2020, 21:07 - Jasnoor Gill: E.g. how do you think Google tracked that their autonomous driving guy uploaded a bunch of docs to cloud storage
09/04/2020, 21:07 - Jasnoor Gill: I honestly don't know which one does the tracking ü§£

They used Amazon Worspaces - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/amazon-workspaces.html

Anybody has a similar setup? 
Any tips on ensuring that the code isn't downloaded, uploaded somewhere else?

10/04/2020, 03:03 - Emmanuel: On the same topic by my fav tech writer. https://skift.com/2020/04/09/the-bull-case-for-airbnbs-future-from-here-on/#click=https://t.co/5gGxC9YsFw
10/04/2020, 03:03 - Emmanuel: "But let‚Äôs fast forward into the future. Will things remain as bad as they are at present, or will they improve? That is the billion-dollar question. And your answer to that question identifies you either as an Airbnb bull or a bear.

Most will fall in the ‚Äúbear‚Äù category, but not me. I guess I have a contrarian point of view of the company. And it starts with two investors ‚Äì Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners ‚Äì who just gave a whopping billion dollars in debt to the company, albeit at draconian terms. In other words, even in this ‚Äúend-of-the-world scenario,‚Äù two savvy investors were ready to take the bet on the company and its future. My main point is that no one gives you a billion dollars unless they see a chance to make money on their investment. And that is a good tell on Airbnb‚Äôs chances. It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me to see lemmings show up and put anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in additional debt into the company. What‚Äôs good for the sharks is good for the pufferfish, right?"
10/04/2020, 03:04 - Emmanuel: https://en.appa.pe/
10/04/2020, 03:06 - Emmanuel: BigRock.in  & https://www.znetlive.com/ have been quite good for me.
10/04/2020, 03:07 - +91 99870 94433: That Silverlake deal hasn't gone through yet btw
10/04/2020, 03:09 - Emmanuel: Hasn't WSJ confirmed it already two days back
10/04/2020, 03:10 - +91 99870 94433: Yea and everyone else has copied it but that deal is still being shopped around by IBs
10/04/2020, 03:10 - +91 99870 94433: So I guess until the definitive documents are signed it's on the table.
10/04/2020, 03:11 - Emmanuel: In that case, its not done until its done.
10/04/2020, 03:11 - +91 99870 94433: Either way, 50% drop and 10% interest ü§Ø
10/04/2020, 03:12 - Emmanuel: If you get a haircut and survive to fight another day why not.
10/04/2020, 03:14 - +91 99870 94433: No doubt. It's just a sign of things to come.
10/04/2020, 03:14 - Emmanuel: draconian terms saving them from neck cut.

10/04/2020, 11:34 - Nazz: Exactly what Yuval Noah Harari warned us about in the FT article. This will be the new normal and we won't be able to say no later if we don't say no now.
10/04/2020, 12:02 - +91 77618 44042: What‚Äôs the alternative if we say no?
10/04/2020, 12:03 - +91 72591 76020: Can you trust this? Specially after hearing of cases where people took paracetamol to avoid temp spikes?
10/04/2020, 12:05 - +91 77618 44042: For every level of scrutiny and blockade, we will always come up with some kind of shortcut/bypass route. That's how we are as humans.
10/04/2020, 12:06 - +91 72591 76020: And because some have no option but to find ways across
10/04/2020, 12:06 - Preetam Nath: It will possibly also give way to more. Unsafe assumption that it will stop at temperature
10/04/2020, 12:07 - +91 77618 44042: Reasons could be plenty...result's the same. Trust breach is a byproduct.
10/04/2020, 12:08 - Nazz: Yuval gives the example of the soap police. Soap usage was not so rampant before, not even nurses did it. Then we were given clear proofs and understanding of why using soap was good for us. Now, we don't need the soap police to make us wash our hands.
10/04/2020, 12:09 - +91 77618 44042: I am thinking of binge watching some post-apocalypse sci-fi movies/series this weekend to get some creative ideas on how the world's gonna look like in the not-so-far future. Any recommendations üòÄüòÄüòÄ
10/04/2020, 12:10 - Nazz: Clear instructions and we'll built narratives can embed habits in the culture itself
10/04/2020, 12:10 - Nazz: We see it well used in politics but not social welfare
10/04/2020, 12:11 - +91 77618 44042: hinds-sight theories look great on articles and books. it's a perspective that makes you think "that makes so much sense!" 

but if you read Yuval's books you'd know he has a remarkable talent of self-contradiction.
10/04/2020, 12:11 - Jasnoor Gill: Anecdotes vs data
10/04/2020, 12:12 - Nazz: Even if you took Yuval out of the picture and looked at history of how culture was built, it gives you a clear view. Conceding once is conceding forever.
10/04/2020, 12:14 - +91 77618 44042: think about it, we shouldn't have to wait for a pandemic to practice hygiene (covering your mouth while coughing/sneezing etc.) and soap usage, right? these are good practices any which way!

if you read about behavioural science, you'd also learn the reason why soaps are made to smell good, toothpastes have mint flavour etc. these have been added just to give us instant reward when building a good habit. again, these things evolved through years and in hindsight it all looks obvious.
10/04/2020, 12:16 - Anuj Gupta: Not necessarily - exposure to germs can be a good thing for building a strong immune system. For example, US has high rates of autoimmune diseases due to the environment being too clean.
10/04/2020, 12:16 - +91 77618 44042: I guess the point I am trying to make is that it's extremely difficult to point at what's right vs wrong at this point. History looks very different while it's happening compared to how it looks like in hindsight üòÄ
10/04/2020, 12:18 - Nazz: Hindsight helps you understand what was wrong and learn from it. We know Nazis were wrong. Most in Nazi Germany didn't think so.
10/04/2020, 12:18 - +91 77618 44042: this is a false assertion. autoimmune is very different from having strong immunity.
10/04/2020, 12:19 - Nazz: You would still use soaps and toothpaste even if it didn't smell great. You take bitter medicines and use ayurvedic toothpastes with not a great taste.
10/04/2020, 12:19 - +91 77618 44042: agreed...and that's why coming back to whether we should say 'No' or 'Yes' to things being implemented in prevailing conditions is very difficult.
10/04/2020, 12:20 - Nazz: And this is where we learn from history to make those decisions (of course keeping current context in the picture) ü§ì
10/04/2020, 12:22 - +91 70328 02600: Black Mirror if you have not seen it already
10/04/2020, 12:24 - +91 77618 44042: We've come a long way to adopting toothpaste and soaps in our life now. Taking medicines/injection when you are ailing is a different case altogether. But it'd have been very very difficult or almost impossible for toothpastes and soaps to gain mass adoption if they were bitter and unpleasant to use - again some behavioural science in play. 

We all know several things that are healthy but we still make unhealthy choices. The brain works in a funny way!

10/04/2020, 12:26 - +91 77618 44042: I won't put my money on vox giving me info on autoimmune diseases. Autoimmune conditions are quite a different subject altogether.
10/04/2020, 12:27 - Preetam Nath: +100
10/04/2020, 12:27 - Anuj Gupta: There are plenty of other sources. Vox are only publishing an article bad on research that has already been done ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/04/2020, 12:27 - Anuj Gupta: based*
10/04/2020, 12:27 - Preetam Nath: Suffering from an autoimmune condition, can vouch most of the regular sites don't know jack

10/04/2020, 12:27 - +44 7774 406149: Great article by Om! Btw In the name of them being big and bloated, I am amazed how quickly they have ‚Äúpivoted‚Äù. They now have long term rentals, and range of online experiences right on their homepage. Long term rental btw was one of the areas for which they have raised money. In fact online experiences idea was first conceptualised by their Italian team.
10/04/2020, 12:28 - Preetam Nath: Most doctors don't know jack. Websites please. Only listen to authority sources who themselves suffer from the same ailment. ONLY they have skin in the game to present proper research
10/04/2020, 12:28 - Anuj Gupta: Not all autoimmune disorders have the same cause. I suffer from one myself, and my cause isn't this. Yet, this might be true at a population level ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/04/2020, 12:29 - Vikas: Last ship on prime video - less talked about
10/04/2020, 12:29 - Preetam Nath: ^exactly why generalised articles on sites like Vox are misleading at best, harmful to some at worst
10/04/2020, 12:29 - +91 77618 44042: I'd agree if the argument was Americans have weaker immunity because of lack of exposure to pathogens and hence not having the antibodies to deal with them. but autoimmune diseases due to cleanliness is BS
10/04/2020, 12:30 - Anuj Gupta: Is this a better source? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2841828/
10/04/2020, 12:30 - Preetam Nath: Also, based on months of painstaking research, there's sufficient evidence about autoimmune diseases being related to gut health, which is related to what you ingest.
10/04/2020, 12:30 - +91 77618 44042: I second that...
10/04/2020, 12:31 - +91 77618 44042: just finished reading a book about this, by a doc.
10/04/2020, 12:31 - Anuj Gupta: Is that the only reason anyone can have autoimmune diseases? Or have you simply found one that applies to what you've observed as well?
10/04/2020, 12:31 - Preetam Nath: Much better source yes üòÅ
10/04/2020, 12:31 - +44 7774 406149: Name of the book?
10/04/2020, 12:32 - Anuj Gupta: Anyway, was just adding a different opinion, we're all free to believe what we want. I personally don't believe in being overprotected, neither in having too much exposure. I think a moderate amount of exposure is good for my immune system
10/04/2020, 12:33 - Shuba Broadsheet: The hygiene hypothesis particularly for allergies (peanut, gluten etc) is well known, but not taken as truth just yet. As for autoimmune diseases- it‚Äôs far more complicated as there are so many kinds and not nearly enough research has gone into this field.
10/04/2020, 12:33 - +91 77618 44042: You read this article? 

"However, these data and others showing a correlation between high disease incidence and high socio-economic level do not prove a causal link between infections and immune disorders. Proof of principle of the hygiene hypothesis is brought by animal models and to a lesser degree by intervention trials in humans. Underlying mechanisms are multiple and complex. 

They include decreased consumption of homeostatic factors and immunoregulation, involving various regulatory T cell subsets and Toll-like receptor stimulation. 

These mechanisms could originate, to some extent, from changes in microbiota caused by changes in lifestyle, particularly in inflammatory bowel diseases. Taken together, these data open new therapeutic perspectives in the prevention of autoimmune and allergic diseases."
10/04/2020, 12:33 - Preetam Nath: Let's get on a shared definition of autoimmune first. Allergies are not autoimmune diseases. Peanut allergy that Americans suffer from that leads to anaphylaxis is not autoimmune disease. Coeliac disease or Lupus is.

Outside the scope of this group, I'm afraid üòÑ
10/04/2020, 12:35 - +91 77618 44042: https://www.amazon.in/Activate-Your-Vagus-Nerve-Sensitivities/dp/1612438741
10/04/2020, 12:35 - Anuj Gupta: Agreed. Let's call them immune system disorders instead. The point remains though.
10/04/2020, 12:36 - +91 99020 11644: Yes. Unfortunately they‚Äôve invented something called wheat gluten allergy - this doesn‚Äôt exist unless it‚Äôs celiac. Completely made up.
10/04/2020, 12:36 - +91 77618 44042: +1 on this, Anuj. 

Relating this to autoimmunity might be stretching the facts. Just saying üôÇ
10/04/2020, 12:36 - Preetam Nath: Everyone on earth is allergic to gluten. The severity is different, is all.
10/04/2020, 12:36 - +44 7774 406149: Thanks!
10/04/2020, 12:37 - Preetam Nath: Completely agreed. This is probably the best use of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger / antifragile
10/04/2020, 12:37 - +91 99020 11644: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-celiac_gluten_sensitivity
10/04/2020, 12:43 - Anuj Gupta: I'm not an expert on autoimmune diseases by any measure. But there is a whole body of research on this. Might not apply to all cases/definitions. https://www.researchgate.net/search/publication?q=Autoimmune%20hygiene
10/04/2020, 12:43 - Preetam Nath: True that, but search enough and you'll find a study that backs up anything.
10/04/2020, 12:44 - Anuj Gupta: In that case, who really knows?
10/04/2020, 12:45 - +91 77618 44042: Can I change the subject and ask for more sci-fi recommendations? 

Watched Mad-max last week. Is great, if anyone fancies that genre.
10/04/2020, 12:45 - Preetam Nath: Observational inferences only. Look for communities where people suffer from said disease, and see what self-reported measures work. Rank them and you'll find lots of insights. Everything I've discovered for my condition has been through this and while 100% is not accurate, it is 100% more useful and effective than any info I got from doctors
10/04/2020, 12:46 - Anuj Gupta: I never said it applies to your condition ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/04/2020, 12:47 - Preetam Nath: let me rephrase: Observational inferences only. Look for communities where people suffer from said disease, and see what self-reported measures work. Rank them and you'll find lots of insights.

10/04/2020, 13:29 - +91 93807 40700: I was just about to write that this reads like an extra-scientific write up about what is more commonly known as leaky gut disease.

10/04/2020, 13:33 - Preetam Nath: Disclaimer: I'm not an authority on any of these topics. There's evidence for and against almost anything in this realm. Due to lack of definitive answers, the best approach is to research, test, eliminate, and ultimately find what works for you.

10/04/2020, 15:20 - +91 99375 36453: Haha. It actually sounded like that!

Read the entire piece and there are tons of these statements

10/04/2020, 16:32 - +91 99375 36453: Would love to know how is this group behaving when it comes to ordering food online
10/04/2020, 16:33 - +91 99375 36453: I've hardly done it twice in the past 15 days, most of the folks in my network aren't ordering as well!
10/04/2020, 16:34 - Nachi: prior to lockdown, what was the average ordering frequency ?
10/04/2020, 16:34 - Nachi: ‚Äã@919937536453  for you personally i mean
10/04/2020, 16:36 - +91 99375 36453: Once in two days
10/04/2020, 16:38 - Amit Singh: We were ordering twice daily till last week. But that's due to both of us being quite occupied with work. 
Now things have become manageable and we are mostly cooking at home. Have ordered only twice this week.
10/04/2020, 17:00 - Kumar Rangarajan: Haven't ordered even once in the last 2 weeks. Typically twice a week shopping nearby (for grocery) and twice or on-demand for veggies. All local shops or from vendors who come to our apartment. 

But expect to go back to BB once it becomes more reliable. It used to be about once every two weeks and we also used BBDaily relatively often. 1-2 times a week.
10/04/2020, 17:23 - +91 95501 55983: but what's the author really trying to say? Mocking startups requesting a bailout might make sense but I couldn't understand the swipe taken against the folks who recommended the lockdown. IMO if even one person got convinced about social distancing because kunal shah said so, is that not worth it?
10/04/2020, 17:24 - Aayush: Alarmists need alarms
10/04/2020, 17:24 - +91 95501 55983: if the author's against the lockdown, he should go into details about why and be specific about how he thinks the alternative solution works. Instead of quoting words which may have been picked up out of context
10/04/2020, 17:25 - Aayush: It‚Äôs a scaled business model issue by default
10/04/2020, 17:35 - Aayush: There are only so many things going wrong and only so many of them have real life solutions
10/04/2020, 17:40 - +91 99305 30939: AKM's point against lockdowns is absolutely stupid. Saying that it's only 4 months old does not make any sense.
10/04/2020, 18:25 - +91 99870 94433: I think the gist of it was that being qualified in one sphere does not make you an expert in another. 

Unless you're Elon Musk üòÇ
10/04/2020, 18:46 - +91 99305 30939: Same goes for AKM too. He's a journalist who doesn't have a speciality in anything
10/04/2020, 18:48 - +91 99305 30939: Unless trolling is a speciality
10/04/2020, 18:52 - +91 95501 55983: +1
10/04/2020, 18:53 - +91 99870 94433: Journalists job or speciality is to report stuff and in some cases draw inferences or state opinions. I don't see the misalignment?
10/04/2020, 18:54 - +91 99870 94433: I don't know AKM specifically and haven't followed his work though.
10/04/2020, 18:54 - Suhas Motwani PM: Ideally yes. But one part is also TRP which I think this post def gathered seeing the discussions above^
10/04/2020, 18:55 - +91 99305 30939: In this case, his point that startups should not have suggested Lockdown. We are not in January 2020.. he's writing this article in April 2020
10/04/2020, 18:55 - +91 99305 30939: All his evidence is one single article from early March about Diamond Princess ship
10/04/2020, 18:56 - +91 99305 30939: Which even the original author put lot of caveats in
10/04/2020, 18:56 - +91 99305 30939: We need Lockdown and we need help for migrant workers, those are not exclusive
10/04/2020, 18:58 - +91 99305 30939: He's clearly not stupid (AKM), and one of the finest writers on Indian startups. So that's why this article makes me sad.
10/04/2020, 19:00 - +91 99305 30939: Western countries are spending 10-20% of their GDP in economic stimulus and helping underprivileged. We need more lobbying for govt help, not less.
10/04/2020, 19:00 - +91 99870 94433: My takeaway from this article is that he is questioning the competence or expertise of certain people in suggesting it.
10/04/2020, 19:00 - +91 99870 94433: Haven't read any of his work that I can recall. Please share.
10/04/2020, 19:01 - +91 99870 94433: Yes but I think VSS / RA don't fit the definition as such. üòÇ
10/04/2020, 19:01 - +91 99305 30939: He took down Foodpanda single handedly. Read his Mint coverage.
10/04/2020, 19:02 - +91 99870 94433: Will do thanks
10/04/2020, 19:30 - Jasnoor Gill: I think he did their redbus coverage too?
10/04/2020, 20:13 - Akash Goenka TVC: His point is regarding the request to impose the lockdown, which is usually by a thinktank and is devoid of much analysis and numbers. Typically when a group does stuff like this, it has to disclose what expertise it has to make such recommendations (like a thinktank), and what interests they represent (like iSpirt). That letter did not have any of that.
10/04/2020, 20:13 - Akash Goenka TVC: The other point about startups asking for bailout is the bigger one, and the request is pathetic at best.
10/04/2020, 20:14 - +91 99870 94433: There are two sides to this. A lot of bootstrapped startups are MSME by definition, with similar cashflow requirements.
10/04/2020, 20:18 - Akash Goenka TVC: True, and a lot of them will die down in a few months for no fault of theirs. But even giving that benefit of doubt here, there's about 50% of the country in a worse position than them who may not sustain beyond a month (at best).
10/04/2020, 21:28 - +91 99870 94433: We're going to be looking at some form of nuclear winter. I don't think it's hit most people's realisation. Hope I'm wrong though.
10/04/2020, 21:37 - Aayush: I agree, was doing some rough math, and the more you think about it the more clear it becomes
10/04/2020, 21:37 - Aayush: What I am trying to understand is China‚Äôs stock market performance
10/04/2020, 21:38 - Aayush: Because that‚Äôs the only bit that bucks the understanding of the trend
10/04/2020, 21:47 - +91 99020 11644: It‚Äôs a shit show. Pardon my French.
10/04/2020, 21:49 - Deepa Venkatraman: You mean the recent uptick?
10/04/2020, 21:49 - Jasnoor Gill: China's stock market is propped up artificially by the ccp
10/04/2020, 21:51 - Deepa Venkatraman: (Hypothesising) Maybe everyone feels that China will emerge from this better than everyone else + China provides more certainty (having flattened the curve) relative to everyone else.

Artificial propping up is possibly happening as well.
10/04/2020, 21:53 - Aayush: But difficult to determine wheat vs chaff
10/04/2020, 21:54 - Aayush: What are the things we can agree on economically because of this pandemic locally and globally to the best of our understanding at present?

Basic question: When do you see all of India being unlockeddown?

The above is a leading question to employment and salaries

11/04/2020, 12:14 - Uday Product Folks: any reliable OTP sms vendor for india ? we have been using MSG91 and delivery rates are quite bad.
11/04/2020, 12:17 - +91 98202 32612: Textlocal.in worked well for us
11/04/2020, 12:35 - +91 93807 40700: Evaluating CustomFit.ai. Still WIP and it seems to do most of what we want. Let me know if you would like me to connect.
11/04/2020, 12:35 - +91 77618 44042: MSG91 delivery is bad for OTP
11/04/2020, 12:35 - +91 77618 44042: We use 2factor
11/04/2020, 12:35 - Mitalee: super. thanks a ton. checking it out.
11/04/2020, 12:35 - +91 77618 44042: But it‚Äôs expensive
11/04/2020, 12:35 - +91 93807 40700: What rates are you looking at?
11/04/2020, 12:36 - +91 77618 44042: For MSG91 the rate is fine but delivery is poor. they charge 14p per OTP
11/04/2020, 12:37 - +91 77618 44042: 2factor is around 20-22p based on your volume...can go down to 18p for 2L+ volume
11/04/2020, 12:37 - +91 77618 44042: But 2factor has great delivery
11/04/2020, 12:37 - +91 93807 40700: Yes I meant delivery rates...
11/04/2020, 12:38 - +91 93807 40700: I think you'll have a success rate? We can take this to DM if you'd like.
11/04/2020, 12:38 - +91 77618 44042: Don‚Äôt have exact rates at the top of my head...but delivery delays are frequent.
11/04/2020, 12:39 - +91 77618 44042: You work with MSG91?
11/04/2020, 12:39 - +91 93807 40700: Kaleyra :)

Need a very critical favor. I am helping a group of volunteers who have been doing some amazing work during this time. They need help/advice on how to setup a donations infra
11/04/2020, 21:04 - Nachi: They are getting approached by people who want to make donations and fund the supply of PPE. But they‚Äôre struggling with logistics.

Since we never inteded to handle monetary donations we are actually discussing more on this. what is the best way to go about this?
11/04/2020, 21:04 - Nachi: this = setting  up a payments or donation infra that doesnt affect the donors or the team later

We use GA to track DAU, MAU.
We have log history in our db as well. How can I calculate MAU from my log history?
13/04/2020, 10:49 - +91 70328 02600: Why is GA not showing you MAU also? Or you want to calculate historical MAU from logs?
13/04/2020, 10:52 - +91 89716 71012: We want to figure out MAU from our db (multiple reasons :-) )
13/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 70328 02600: Should be easily possible using SQL. Write query with unique customerids per month
13/04/2020, 10:55 - +91 70328 02600: If you want a graphical tool, things like Kibana should work - https://www.elastic.co/kibana
13/04/2020, 10:55 - +91 72591 76020: Which dB?
13/04/2020, 10:55 - +91 72591 76020: As in sql or nosql ?
13/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 72591 76020: Also... logs or dB?
13/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 70328 02600: Logs would be in some DB i am assuming :)
13/04/2020, 10:57 - Ujjwal Trivedi: I guess the definition was the real issue. 
Sorted now?

Definition was the issue.

13/04/2020, 11:51 - Nachi: ^whatsapp message only. not calling friendly
13/04/2020, 11:52 - +91 99305 30939: Is that allowed during the lockdown?
13/04/2020, 11:53 - Nachi: why, you gonna snitch?
13/04/2020, 11:53 - +91 99305 30939: No no
13/04/2020, 11:53 - Nachi: haha jk
13/04/2020, 11:53 - +91 99305 30939: Will Dunzo accept
13/04/2020, 11:54 - Nachi: we dont know what essential need Shashank might have. I trust his judgement on whats best for him
13/04/2020, 11:54 - Nachi: and dunzo swiggy accept all things they can carry
13/04/2020, 11:54 - Nachi: govt guidelines said ecommerce is allowed
13/04/2020, 11:54 - +91 99305 30939: Only for essential items
13/04/2020, 11:54 - Nachi: they didnt explicitly include computer items
13/04/2020, 11:55 - +91 99305 30939: Flipkart and Amazon are only selling Essential items for example
13/04/2020, 11:55 - Nachi: but given the state of affairs, people WFH it seems reasonable
13/04/2020, 11:55 - Nachi: its their prerogative
13/04/2020, 11:55 - Nachi: organizations err in side of caution
13/04/2020, 11:56 - +91 99305 30939: I'm not talking about reasonable.. whether Dunzo will accept or not, or whether some police guy, if he checks it, would not seize it
13/04/2020, 11:56 - Nachi: anyway, its upto @919741825657  , the merchant and dunzo
13/04/2020, 11:56 - Nachi: police dont check packages being sent via dunzo
13/04/2020, 11:56 - +91 99305 30939: Got it
13/04/2020, 11:57 - +91 91080 14100: Hearing Dunzo partners are checking if items are essential
13/04/2020, 11:57 - +91 91080 14100: Atleast in Bangalore
13/04/2020, 11:58 - Nachi: p.s: jsut a headsup, electronics will be included in essential category soon. Thats being discussed for easing lockdown restrictions while helping people practise social distancing
13/04/2020, 11:59 - Nachi: this is from the proposed plan i read as part of a little task force w/ GoI
13/04/2020, 12:00 - +91 99305 30939: Yes it makes no sense to have electronics not there. What if someone's phone or laptop has broken down.

Not sure why it's not being allowed in eCommerce even now.
13/04/2020, 12:02 - Nachi: well the whole thing was planned in a hurry. A lot of members in the planning committee are of the opinion that smartphones are a luxury
13/04/2020, 12:02 - +91 97418 25657: Thanks Nachi. Will explicitly mention that they are computer accessories in Dunzo task and let them take the call. Honestly, unsure what is categoried as essential/non-essential.

With WFH, some items are definitely essential for folks like us.
13/04/2020, 12:04 - Nachi: if dunzo fails, try swiggy genie.
13/04/2020, 12:04 - Nachi: one of them should be able to deliver. have used them the last couple of weeks
13/04/2020, 12:04 - Nachi: without trouble
13/04/2020, 13:12 - Uday Product Folks: Our android app is used by 2 cohorts of users for one cohort the users get 30 day free trial and can start using the app right away and for the other cohort they will have to pay and there is no free trial before using the app. 

I tried putting in a button selection in the onboarding flow which a user would select and that would help us moving them along the right flow.  But what is happening is that users are mixing up the selection and they are ending up in different flows. 

Any thoughts on how to solve for this

13/04/2020, 14:16 - +91 93807 40700: I think you can use Dunzo/Swiggy Genie. Some institutions have been using it to send laptops to new employees as part of the onboarding process.
13/04/2020, 14:32 - Vikas Ranga Doument. ai: Lalamove and Rapido also provide similar service
13/04/2020, 15:40 - +91 70328 02600: What are some good blogs/ resources for current SEO practices? Esp. for B2B SaaS US audience. I know basic SEO and used it effectively 3 years ago. Need an updated primer on it - on what has changed in recent times.
13/04/2020, 15:50 - +91 99375 36453: Following
13/04/2020, 15:57 - Jai Quickride: Marie Haynes has a good blog, pretty detailed and regular. This is for SEO in general though, not specific to the demographic you asked for.
13/04/2020, 16:01 - +91 70328 02600: Thanks Jai. Didn't know about her. Will check

13/04/2020, 17:46 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Ahrefs has grown to over 5M visitors per month under 2 years - Pure Organic Traffic!

Some exceptionally work with the content Marketing they've done!
13/04/2020, 17:46 - Suumit Shah Rankz: **exceptional
13/04/2020, 17:47 - +91 70328 02600: Any notes from what worked for them?
13/04/2020, 17:47 - Suumit Shah Rankz: The kind of value they provide through the articles on their blog is crazy!
13/04/2020, 17:48 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Then they blend their product in the blogposts
13/04/2020, 17:48 - Suumit Shah Rankz: But I can see they are able to Rank for the crazy high completion Keywords like "domain authority"
13/04/2020, 17:50 - +91 70328 02600: So just hardcore long valuable articles
13/04/2020, 17:50 - +91 70328 02600: ?
13/04/2020, 17:50 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Correct
13/04/2020, 17:50 - Suumit Shah Rankz: And you'll have to build high quality Links at the beginning in order to get some momentum
13/04/2020, 17:53 - +91 70328 02600: Good sources for this? Guest posting?
13/04/2020, 18:05 - Suumit Shah Rankz: If you have time, yes - manual ourreach!
13/04/2020, 18:06 - Suumit Shah Rankz: If you want to save time and accelerate things - use Rankz.io to start posting on blogs who accept sponsored posts
13/04/2020, 18:16 - Jai Quickride: The last I checked (5 months back) Google is increasingly getting better at detecting such sites with sponsored links, so that may have a negative SEO effect as well. Is that right @919766149326 ?
13/04/2020, 18:17 - Jai Quickride: I think Link Building has been covered the best by Backlinko. Check out the Skyscraper technique.
13/04/2020, 18:17 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Do everything that Google says don't do ;)
13/04/2020, 18:17 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Yup - being used by 6387479394 other SEO's :)
13/04/2020, 18:18 - Suumit Shah Rankz: "exclusive" links is the way to go - which your competitors can't replicate so easily

"Entering the second phase of the lockdown to fight the Covid-19 pandemic beginning April 15, the government of Odisha has relaxed its norms to allow home delivery of all goods through e-commerce or online platforms.

The order may have allowed delivery of any kind of product and services by online platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart and logistics companies, it‚Äôs not clear whether large e-commerce firms would open up their platform for just one, two, or a few states.

Due to the ongoing lockdown, e-commerce major Flipkart is currently accepting orders for essentials only while Amazon has been servicing select pin codes and only delivering grocery essentials."
14/04/2020, 16:17 - Nazz: Just thinking Goodbox would have been a great app in the current situation. It could have been it's Paytm-DeMo moment
14/04/2020, 16:18 - Preetam Nath: üò¢
14/04/2020, 16:51 - Aayush: They had many such moments
14/04/2020, 16:51 - Aayush: Couldn‚Äôt capitalise well
14/04/2020, 16:51 - Aayush: And the industry issue right now is not that delivery apps don‚Äôt exist, but no matter who exists, there aren‚Äôt enough delivery boys who are on the ground
14/04/2020, 17:03 - Nazz: Not in context of delivery but the ability to converse with local shops and understand stock and coordinate pickup.
14/04/2020, 18:37 - Adam Walker: hey folks. is anyone aware of a tool that can do correlation analysis between a group of user attributes?

The context is that I want to map 5 attributes to a list of our paid users [age of Shopify store, last month's GMV, count of sales, employee count, Alexa rank].

I want to then find which of these user attributes is most statistically significant to predicting whether a user will become a paid user. 

I have tried both Amplitude and MixPanel, but neither tool support user_attributes, only events (like clicks, page views, different activities etc.)
14/04/2020, 18:39 - Adam Walker: @918778164531 @919769003072 @918527141637 @919482529829 @917720020392 @919650068620 @919769503268 @919910270434 @917259998836 
would any of you know?
14/04/2020, 18:40 - +91 97690 03072: I don‚Äôt remember adequate excel off my head but this should be fairly decent to figure out using excel.
14/04/2020, 18:40 - +91 6361 304 501: I think user_attributes might work on amplitude if you use segment
14/04/2020, 18:41 - +91 97690 03072: If I got the question right - a multi variate correlation analysis.
14/04/2020, 18:41 - Adam Walker: nope. personas doesn't take user attributes
14/04/2020, 18:42 - Adam Walker: MixPanel used to have a feature, but they deprecated it
14/04/2020, 18:42 - Adam Walker: that sounds about right
14/04/2020, 18:45 - Shuba Broadsheet: I've used SPSS- but that's truly first principles. Would love to know of a simpler more contemporary tool.
14/04/2020, 18:46 - Adam Walker: yeah, I used to use SAS, but it's super un- user friendly
14/04/2020, 18:47 - Aayush: Isn‚Äôt this tool ultimately something that just tests various statistical methods over key ID and attributes ascertaining the correlation strength?
14/04/2020, 18:47 - Adam Walker: yes
14/04/2020, 18:53 - Adam Walker: <Media omitted>
14/04/2020, 19:00 - Adam Walker: Has anyone used https://www.datarobot.com before?
14/04/2020, 19:37 - +91 99020 11644: I believe you can do that in the paid version of mixpanel using cohorts
14/04/2020, 19:37 - +91 99020 11644: If I understood you correctly
14/04/2020, 19:38 - Adam Walker: I don't think so anymore. it used to be the feature "Predict", but they have since deprecated it
14/04/2020, 19:41 - Aayush: Because it doesn‚Äôt work well
14/04/2020, 19:41 - Aayush: All business have different ways of determining attributes to strengths to outcomes
14/04/2020, 19:42 - Aayush: The only way if to use tools on top
Of DBs with key IDs and attributes for each key ID
14/04/2020, 19:43 - Adam Walker: that I have. 
I found a tool called MadKudu that looks like it's targeting this issue https://www.madkudu.com
14/04/2020, 19:47 - Aayush: Decent direction, however looks very limited in approach, plus pricing looks exorbitant
14/04/2020, 19:49 - Adam Walker: @919738199828 can you explain the limitation, further? 
yeah, pricing is steep, but you should see some of these other tools!
And if it's going to increase conversion rates, it'll sure pay for itself
14/04/2020, 19:50 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: I believe Freshworks uses it
14/04/2020, 19:53 - Aayush: Hope they build a version of this soon then
14/04/2020, 19:55 - Aayush: This message was deleted
14/04/2020, 19:55 - Aayush: This is not a B2B only problem and anyone trying to solve only the conversational user first approach is going down a bad rabbit hole.

This problem statement is much larger in B2C then it will ever be on B2B.

And it had to consider all properties of a company and not just be chat first (which is  what I got).
14/04/2020, 19:57 - Adam Walker: oh no, it's not using chat based data. 
You can pipe your entire Customer Data via Segment into MadKudu. So then you can look at tons of attributes. 
In my use case I want to look at (we work with Ecommerce stores) monthly GMV, monthly unit sales, age of store, employee count, campaigns sent (using PushOwl), Alexa Rank etc.
14/04/2020, 19:58 - Aayush: $1000 for 2000 leads
14/04/2020, 19:58 - Aayush: Or key IDs
14/04/2020, 19:58 - Aayush: Neither will one have enough training data
14/04/2020, 19:58 - Aayush: Not one will understand strength at those levels
14/04/2020, 19:59 - Aayush: Let me get a demo nonetheless, I have signed up
14/04/2020, 20:00 - Nachi: I use tableau. It has really good modules for doing this
14/04/2020, 20:01 - Aayush: +1 a tool like that is actually the first building block
14/04/2020, 20:01 - Aayush: Is the founder of Factors.AI here?
14/04/2020, 20:01 - Praveen Inmobi: Yup and following the discussion
14/04/2020, 20:01 - Praveen Inmobi: Yup to this
14/04/2020, 20:01 - Aayush: This message was deleted
14/04/2020, 20:02 - Aayush: Thanks for the +1 btw
14/04/2020, 20:03 - Aayush: Forget such complicated stuff, the easiest visual SQL query builder (or equivalent) itself will itself solve a huge market.

Nobody comes close to my limited knowledge.

Do suggest if you have names though
14/04/2020, 20:04 - Praveen Inmobi: MadKudu has good reviews. Know a bunch of folks who use it.
14/04/2020, 20:04 - Aayush: You should check Factors.AI

I just checked them and their direction seems much better (however looks pretty broad at the moment).

Would love some actionable examples of your website @918971011006
14/04/2020, 20:07 - Praveen Inmobi: Thanks. @919900707604 - we have spoken once before and had done a demo of our product. Our website doesn‚Äôt do justice to the product today. In the process of being redone as we speak.

Would be great if we could catch up once again
14/04/2020, 20:08 - Aayush: Yeah I just realised we have met, bad memory. Yes your website doesn‚Äôt do justice to your feature set you have described. Lots of hope for this - best of luck.
14/04/2020, 20:18 - +91 81233 27117: Metabase? Their Query builder just gets better and better. Also following causal.app closely, they can nail a lot of things right.
14/04/2020, 20:19 - +91 81233 27117: Qlik is also not bad.
14/04/2020, 20:21 - Aayush: Unless SQL becomes like Excel or in fact better, this category is wide open
14/04/2020, 20:22 - Aayush: ThoughtSpot might get there, although haven‚Äôt seen their product in recent times (also guessing they are very costly to both set-up and use)
14/04/2020, 20:23 - Aayush: Don‚Äôt know about Casual.app, will check
14/04/2020, 21:18 - Adam Walker: sending you a DM!
14/04/2020, 22:23 - Adam Walker: sorry, not super product related, but may add value to the community.

It could be technical; how do you do it at Zoho; or a personal experience question. 

On the 25th I'm hosting a "fireside chat" style webinar with Praval Singh. I'd be grateful to hear what is/are the most important questions you would have for someone with his experience and position. This way I can work those questions into our webinar.¬†

15/04/2020, 13:51 - Adam Walker: lol, that's maybe too personal
15/04/2020, 13:52 - +91 6361 304 501: Okay - Girish Mathrubootham says that an Indian SaaS can have a 2.5 CAC to LTV. Do you agree and why?
15/04/2020, 13:52 - +91 91080 14100: Didn't they just sue them
15/04/2020, 13:52 - +91 6361 304 501: :-)
15/04/2020, 13:53 - +91 91080 14100: How is selling in India different from clients overseas. How does India shape their products ( if at all )
15/04/2020, 13:54 - Adam Walker: great
15/04/2020, 13:55 - Adam Walker: yeah, this could be interesting. The two companies have different DNA, so there could be a different perspective on this
15/04/2020, 13:57 - +91 70328 02600: Curious, what is the difference in DNA between them?
15/04/2020, 13:58 - Adam Walker: Two that I'm aware of are:
- Sridhar Vembu believes that software should just be cheap and nearly free, as it's marginal cost of production is nearly 0
- Sridhar Vembu is building a privately owned company, whereas Girish is building a company to IPO
15/04/2020, 14:04 - +91 70328 02600: Interesting! Yeah, read some where that Mr. Vembu doesn't want to go public or get acquired. They just want to build a huge profitable private company
15/04/2020, 14:09 - Preetam Nath: Love it!
15/04/2020, 14:22 - +91 70328 02600: Yeah. And pretty bold. If you listen to him, you realise that there are multiple ways in which businesses can be built.

15/04/2020, 14:24 - +91 70328 02600: It inspired me so much that I had to blog about it üôÇ - https://blog.pranay01.com/software/writing-good-software-is-a-craft/
15/04/2020, 14:42 - +91 96633 75213: Folks, does anyone here know of/contribute to open source projects (by way of identifying the problem, writing requirements and managing the development of it)?

Trying to find live instances of well written problem statements and PRDs. The closest I found was a product hunt PRD.
15/04/2020, 14:45 - Mitalee: On GitHub, closest to PRDs are the issue trackers. They have tags and comments, based on which the developers iterate on open source code

Would love to hear from folks in Curefit, Udaan.
16/04/2020, 17:22 - +91 99806 19723: Hi! Does anyone know of any app (open-source, public or self-developed) for ensuring social distancing among supply chain personnel, especially in warehouses?
16/04/2020, 17:23 - +91 99806 19723: Alarms on <6 ft proximity of another device, Notifications to Admin...that sort
16/04/2020, 17:49 - +91 81233 27117: 21st or 3rd?
16/04/2020, 17:49 - +91 99375 36453: 21st
16/04/2020, 17:50 - +91 99375 36453: Many of the IT companies have been allowed to let a maximum of 50% of workforce resume.

Again, there are a lot of regulations there as well.
16/04/2020, 17:52 - +91 81233 27117: We are looking at asking teams that have been unproductive to start going to office from 3rd. For Rest all working from home it is.
16/04/2020, 19:50 - +91 98909 99199: In the constant talks of 'Funding is frozen by VCs', this is actually an inspiring news :)
16/04/2020, 20:11 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Isn't it only for IT-ITES ?
16/04/2020, 20:16 - Aayush: Doesn‚Äôt matter because May 15-18 will see new peak given directions at the moment
16/04/2020, 20:20 - Nazz: There is an app that alerts friends if someone gets out of their home zone. They are refactoring that to create a version that alerts admins in the UP govt. Can connect to the team and they can build something. They were Wingify people and built this as part of the Coronavirus Hackathon by Paras Chopra.
16/04/2020, 20:22 - +91 99809 65477: These are great products, I'm sure but their effectiveness depends completely on adoption. Even among smartphone users, piggybacking the tracking feature on an existing app would be much more effective. Facebook has a nearby friends option already. They could easily extend it to this use case.
16/04/2020, 20:23 - Aayush: +1
16/04/2020, 20:23 - +91 99809 65477: Not sure why no global lobbying for that.
16/04/2020, 20:23 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Doesn't Arogya setu do it? 
At least description says it does records all potential collisions and alerts you if your risk has increased due to it.
16/04/2020, 20:23 - +91 97046 73794: Nope
16/04/2020, 20:24 - +91 99870 94433: privacy?
16/04/2020, 20:24 - Aayush: Where is the raw data from? Patient update? Frequency of update?
16/04/2020, 20:24 - +91 99809 65477: Opt in
16/04/2020, 20:24 - Ujjwal Trivedi: No it is bluetooth + GPS
16/04/2020, 20:24 - Aayush: We will discuss that after Facebook buys 10% of Jio
16/04/2020, 20:24 - +91 99870 94433: then lobbying won't be a big gamechanger.
16/04/2020, 20:24 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Lol
16/04/2020, 20:24 - +91 99870 94433: lol the question was global lobbying
16/04/2020, 20:24 - Aayush: But how does efficacy happen?
16/04/2020, 20:25 - Aayush: Because 200 MN people who don‚Äôt have Corona use it?
16/04/2020, 20:25 - Aayush: What‚Äôs the incentive for someone with Corona or someone suspected with Corona to use the app?
16/04/2020, 20:26 - Aayush: Just needs the right journalist to make it seem that way
16/04/2020, 20:26 - Aayush: Wait till Fox buys Republic for that one
16/04/2020, 20:26 - +91 97046 73794: Its like the dating app happn.. the main use-case is.. when a patient (who is on the app already) gets diagnosed positive with COVID-19. they can do contact tracing.
16/04/2020, 20:26 - Aayush: Cute
16/04/2020, 20:26 - +91 97046 73794: This is also what Google + Apple are trying to do.

16/04/2020, 20:27 - Preetam Nath: When do you expect this deal to complete? And aside from WhatsApp/Jio Pay being born out of this collab, what else can we expect to happen?
16/04/2020, 20:27 - Aayush: It completed in 2014, reported now
16/04/2020, 20:28 - +91 99375 36453: I thought it was kept on hold
16/04/2020, 20:28 - +91 99375 36453: Where did you read that?
16/04/2020, 20:29 - Aayush: I would like Kiran Jogan(forgot his name) to reply to that one
16/04/2020, 20:29 - Aayush: Will love to see what he has to say about zero rating now
16/04/2020, 20:29 - Aayush: And what he intends to do about it
16/04/2020, 20:29 - Aayush: Same thing about this one
16/04/2020, 20:31 - Aayush: Solve the privacy vs efficacy trolley problem

16/04/2020, 20:40 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Zero rating?
16/04/2020, 20:41 - Jasnoor Gill: some apps being free on a provider network selectively
16/04/2020, 20:41 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Oh yeah that campaign.
16/04/2020, 20:41 - Jasnoor Gill: the whole drama over the fb basics and so on
16/04/2020, 20:41 - Aayush: Or when you buy Nestle Milk you get 100 MB free Airtel data
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Jasnoor Gill: i dont think that was the issue.
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Aayush: It‚Äôs economically impossible to stop
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Aayush: It‚Äôs a twisted way to do the same thing
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Aayush: You can‚Äôt stop zero rating in the world we live
16/04/2020, 20:42 - +91 99870 94433: Jio has been building freebasics Ambani spec for a while now
16/04/2020, 20:42 - Aayush: Duh

16/04/2020, 20:43 - +91 99870 94433: Lol I meant their internal product pipeline. They acquired a friends company that was focused on one aspect of this. 2years ago may be
16/04/2020, 20:44 - Jasnoor Gill: I doubt it :) @919886944331 are you willing to tell us when you started raising? I am guessing pre covid/lockdown...
16/04/2020, 20:49 - Ujjwal Trivedi: What is announced now doesn't remotely mean the deal was closed now. 

From what I have heard, It may take 3 to 9 months between deal and money hitting the bank account. Announcements kinda happen anywhere in between. 

Happy to stand corrected.
16/04/2020, 20:50 - Ujjwal Trivedi: @918778164531 can throw some light in general.
16/04/2020, 20:50 - Ujjwal Trivedi: @919900707604 too
16/04/2020, 20:51 - Jasnoor Gill: i know, just getting confirmation ;)
16/04/2020, 20:52 - Aayush: As with everything else in life, timing is important, both of raising and of announcements

And this is positive news

So helps everyone to feel better and go onwards and upwards

There goes Zoom out the window
17/04/2020, 09:04 - +91 91084 44561: I think the whole brouhaha over zoom is completely over the top. 

1. It is not malware; it‚Äôs security features were perfectly adequate for its earlier role as a corporate comms tool supplementing offline comms. Through an act of god it is in the position of overnight needing to adjust to a dramatically more mission critical role that makes it a much more lucrative target. And it has recognised the problem and is investing heavily in fixing it on a war footing. 

2. There are enough features already to preempt abuses like photobombing. Perhaps not at a ux simplicity that works for casual users but certainly at a level that any serious user can be expected to explore and utilise. 

3. Microsoft and Google are both well connected to governments. I am sure they have a role to play in fomenting this outrage

4. Zoom is perhaps not suitable for government interactions, given state-funded interest in compromising those interactions. Fair, so let governments not use them but that is a very different threat profile to typical B2B interactions 

Overall, making a great product is bloody hard and zoom is a great product, certainly for the world they were in just weeks ago. They are making an honest attempt to adapt to this new normal, which is all anyone can ask for. 

The amount of hysterical hand waving out there about the zoomocalypse is both annoying and mildly amusing.
17/04/2020, 09:05 - Jasnoor Gill: But but it's Chinese! :Sputter sputter: :outrage outrage:
17/04/2020, 10:17 - Aamna Khan: Arre yaar
17/04/2020, 10:22 - Nikhil Kumar: Hi Folks, Sorry for the late response. Sahil (my cofounder) was a VC before and he had this nagging intuition (Back in July 2019) that financial markets will get worse in 2020. All economic indicators also pointed towards that!

So we started the raising process in Oct 2019 and signed the TS in Dec 2019. We were still chilling with paperwork in January. Only early feb, when COVID was about to take off, we doubled down and finished everything in 2-3 weeks. 

Our lawyers said we were one of the very very few whose TS was honoured as agreed by investors!
17/04/2020, 10:25 - Nikhil Kumar: That's correct. People announce at various different times based on their needs. Sometimes, even before money has hit the bank account. In our case, we filed new share issuance to the MCA. Entrackr has written a script which tracks changes in filings for a select list of companies it looks like. So, soon as we do regulatory filing, boom media gets to know and publish! (As founders, we almost have no say now on when to announce to whether to announce at all :\)

17/04/2020, 11:25 - +91 6361 304 501: His gross margins are almost like SaaS. Bill Gates gives him 50 billion, but he only has to pay out 5-10 billion in the next life.
17/04/2020, 11:29 - +91 6361 304 501: Sorry I think I misheard. I think he actually said he‚Äôd give him back 5-10 million.  So, better than SaaS.

17/04/2020, 14:35 - Abhishek Dey Hyperverge Product Head: Guys, I need help with carrying out one research. Need following data point to understand affluent population distribution across major Indian cities:
1) Distribution of population across major cities in India along with income distribution - Sec A1, A2, A3, Sec B1, B2 etc.
2) Registration of Cars city wise & Car segment wise. Need to know how many cars of value 8-10lakhs per city
3) Real state inventory - Sold/unsold -> more focus on 3+BHK  properties. 3BHK being used a proxy for high value property.

Any research, link, reference to get access to this data would be of great help. TIA
17/04/2020, 14:38 - Abhishek Dey Hyperverge Product Head: Cars & House Inventory being used as a proxy for affluence. Any other proxy would also help.

Hi Guys,

I am Manish, having 7+ years of cross-functional and cross-sectoral experience.

I have worked with multiple organizations including some of India's biggest unicorns, Ola Cabs, and Mu-Sigma. Currently working with Bounce in the Product Management for New Initiatives.

Happy to connect with you all, will try to contribute maximum from my end and in parallel grow myself in the Product Management domain and also as an overall individual via inputs from all. DM me for any specific queries, especially from the Mobility world :)
17/04/2020, 14:55 - +91 99089 50101: Thank you for adding me to the group @918105011844 and @917008230661. 

My name is Pradyut Roy, and I'm the Product Manager for Zoho's Service Management product, which is also their biggest product. I've been with Zoho for close to 8 years now, and have worked on several enterprise IT Infrastructure management software products. 

Glad to be a part of this group. Looking forward to learning from you all, and sharing what I learn.

What other alternatives of Builtwith have you tried?

"Top BMC officials told mid-day that "the person has been put in quarantine because of a complaint from the PMO office. This means there is a complaint from Aarogya Setu app received by the Maharashtra government."

The woman confirmed to mid-day that she had downloaded the Aarogya Setu app and filled in the information.

Another officer said, "The action was taken on the basis of a message from the state government to the ward office. This may have something to do with contact tracing. This is a purely precautionary measure."

DMing you.
18/04/2020, 20:52 - +91 98861 70474: I wonder how long back Zomato had put this idea in cold storage. Doubtful of this sticking around for longer than a year at most especially considering the fact that majority of diners seemingly prefer the ordering process to be interactive ("What's your best dish?", "Does this taste good?" etc etc). Thoughts? 

https://yourstory.com/2020/04/coronavirus-contactless-delivery-zomato-contactless-dining
18/04/2020, 21:01 - +91 93807 40700: I suppose some interactions could still be enabled through the app, like a chatbot or chat with a waiter... But all this seems to do is reduce a diner's exposure to handling a menu that could have been handled by waiters and other diners. Someone is still going to bring the dish to your table... and handle your cutlery and other arrangements when they sent the table. Is that really a significant reduction in exposure?
18/04/2020, 21:04 - +91 93807 40700: It's cool that they're bringing the concepts of automated drive-in ordering, and ordering take-out via app, to restaurants... But it doesn't really give me enough peace of mind to go and dine in at a restaurant.
18/04/2020, 21:05 - +91 98861 70474: Definitely. 

"Contextual Novelty" - that's what came to mind when I first read it. Hence the limited shelf life expectation. 

I don't think we as a collective have matured so much on self serve models to for this to be adopted this in the long run by a relatively wide TG.
18/04/2020, 21:05 - +91 93807 40700: How do others feel? Would you go dine in if a restaurant offered this?
18/04/2020, 21:06 - +91 98861 70474: Very Japan-esque
18/04/2020, 21:06 - +91 93807 40700: *set the table
18/04/2020, 21:12 - +91 93807 40700: I feel like younger kids would think it's super cool and use it just because of the coolness factor. Those who dine in for the full experience... highly doubt they would adopt.

It'll be interesting to see which restaurants Zomato actively pursues to pitch this to and which ones take it up.

Secondly, they haven't said anything about disinfecting furniture after every use. There's still a chance of contracting infection from previous guests.

I thought it was quite unethical, to try and push a novelty feature as a solution to the problem we're facing.

Which are the SaaS tools that you use in your business or organization, which you:

1)  dislike/hate to use, but need to use anyway because there's no better alternative

2) love to use, but feel you are paying too much (scale for feeling: you're paying $XXXX/mo when you wish it were 5 times cheaper)

There are major cashflow issues in some startups. 
Creating an initiative to connect companies who have money with those who don't.
19/04/2020, 12:28 - Amit Singh: Want to learn about the process involved in acquihiring.
19/04/2020, 12:32 - +91 97690 03072: The folks at Belong are driving this as an initiative.
19/04/2020, 12:32 - +91 97690 03072: Can connect you to Rishabh if required. Not sure we have any belong folks on here
19/04/2020, 12:33 - +91 97690 03072: I think would be good to work with them on this. They have a large set of demand and supply. And know the process also fairly well
19/04/2020, 12:35 - Amit Singh: Noted.

19/04/2020, 12:46 - Amit Singh: On behalf of Headstart. 
Connected with 2, will do with the rest as well. 
But a lot of our work happens in Tier 2. 
Not a very deep tech play there. And they are adversely hit. 
So need to create a broader canvas. 

Belong also focuses only on VC funded startups.
19/04/2020, 12:47 - +91 97690 03072: Belong is widened to corporates, also, I believe.
19/04/2020, 12:47 - Jasnoor Gill: Tier 2 acquihire will be hard, hiring people in the same city is 1 thing, opening a new office in a new city is entirely different (assuming tech)
19/04/2020, 12:48 - Jasnoor Gill: Best bet might be to see who else is in those cities and has a business model not that impacted
19/04/2020, 13:47 - +91 98929 43123: Interesting. I would expect companies may be more open to remote since the current remote only situation is forcing everyone to figure out how to do this well.

19/04/2020, 13:58 - Jasnoor Gill: Sure, but at that point what's the adv of an acqui hire? The primary one usually is that you get a team that works well together etc and has cohesive leadership, who may be compensated well to stay etc. With all remote, that becomes harder to do. No different from sharing Excel sheets around then with profiles
19/04/2020, 14:01 - Jasnoor Gill: Or specialised knowledge/exp. Also usually based on trust that the leaders will stay and the whole team won't fall apart etc in 3 months with people leaving. Harder to do remote.
19/04/2020, 14:02 - Jasnoor Gill: Then maybe look for review only companies willing to hire that many people, which will be hard at this point imo with the uncertainty.
19/04/2020, 14:02 - Jasnoor Gill: *remote only

19/04/2020, 16:17 - +91 98929 43123: Yeah. Definitely harder to do remote, but all are going to learn how to do this for their own orgs & teams. Lots of the right disciplines are highlighted for a fully distributed team. 
 A heavy focus on planning, drive better clarity, transparency both ways, a culture of trust. 

 I contend as orgs figure out how to do this for their own teams and for people they're already getting on in this fully distributed setup, then integrating a new set of team members from a tier 2 city should become more of an option.
19/04/2020, 16:18 - +91 98929 43123: What a great idea Maanav! This was manually curated I presume -- you starred interesting messages?
19/04/2020, 16:22 - +91 98929 43123: Yeah, I expect this is going to change how orgs function and think. 
But as the weeks become months, orgs are going to hear: "Damn, it isn't easy to wfh for all though. Most Indian homes aren't setup for this! "
19/04/2020, 16:24 - Aayush: They will incentivise this structure
19/04/2020, 16:24 - Aayush: And both sides stand to somewhat gain from this

20/04/2020, 14:03 - Nachi: a) Anticipate emergency. Book advance for an emergency is kinda oxymoronic

20/04/2020, 14:04 - Nachi: and (B) Who in their right minds thought this is the best time to send this instead of a more empathetic, contrite one.
20/04/2020, 14:05 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Perhaps you have put more thought than the sender of this notification.
20/04/2020, 14:06 - Nachi: i think i put more thought than the sender writing the last message :P
20/04/2020, 14:07 - Nachi: i hope folks from ola in this group or people who know people take note.
20/04/2020, 14:07 - Nachi: now back to scheduled zoom programming. :)
20/04/2020, 14:08 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Or it may be due to withdrawal symptoms, now that the stocks are getting over.
20/04/2020, 14:14 - +91 81233 27117: Is Ola Emergency a category line/feature? They should have kept a better name or Segregate them into essentials use and emergency.
20/04/2020, 15:14 - Anuj Gupta: They seem to be allowing bookings to hospitals only. In my location, there don't seem to be any cars. So maybe through Ride Later they are trying to anticipate demand or trying to implement some sort of FCFS queuing? That notification is definitely funny though üòÇ
20/04/2020, 15:14 - Anuj Gupta: Also, can't this feature be exploited? Just book a cab to the hospital closest to wherever you want to go üëÄ

20/04/2020, 15:57 - Nachi: you need documentation (relevant and in order). They have been very "strict" and at times pretty rough about it.
20/04/2020, 15:58 - +91 77618 44042: What kind of docs?
20/04/2020, 15:59 - +91 77618 44042: Just curious
20/04/2020, 16:02 - +91 99870 94433: Only with tax paying citizenry lol
20/04/2020, 16:03 - Nachi: meaning?
20/04/2020, 16:03 - Nachi: can you elaborate?
20/04/2020, 16:10 - +91 99870 94433: The HDK/HDG/HDN marriage convoy speaks for itself.
20/04/2020, 16:37 - Nachi: i hear you. also i think you are implying politcians assuming HDK is HD kumaraswamy

20/04/2020, 20:11 - Aayush: Red Giraffe looks like a better tool for rent primafacie
20/04/2020, 20:12 - Aayush: 1.5%? Or so is a pretty big cost
20/04/2020, 20:12 - Aayush: Red Giraffe is something like 0.35%
20/04/2020, 20:13 - Aayush: This will offset any gain via Cred
20/04/2020, 20:14 - Jasnoor Gill: Depends on your card etc
20/04/2020, 20:14 - Jasnoor Gill: But yeah, other options are better
20/04/2020, 20:14 - Aayush: May be base effect might help Cred, which could what its after
20/04/2020, 20:17 - Jasnoor Gill: Yeah, not very many use it today
20/04/2020, 20:17 - +91 99305 30939: Makes no sense. Redgirraffe is 0.39% + taxes
20/04/2020, 20:17 - +91 99305 30939: Even Nobroker is only 1%
20/04/2020, 20:17 - Aayush: Why would you pay 1.5%-2.0% on big transaction every month?

Perhaps to extend rent cycle by 30 days.

So for that specific populace for whom this is a justified cost they would keep doing this.

Double whammy is when UPI charges folks soon enough.

Waiting for what happens then.
20/04/2020, 20:17 - Jasnoor Gill: But how many ppl use redgiraffe today? It's cumbersome. I have up n use nobroker
20/04/2020, 20:17 - Jasnoor Gill: *gave
20/04/2020, 20:18 - Aayush: Yes onboarding = advantage
20/04/2020, 20:20 - Aayush: Having said that Cred will have to get into loans sooner or later, possibly via a soft credit card, then a hard credit card, which will also act as a physical pass to seemingly Cred exclusive stuff. Choice is either retail lending (now) or P2P lending (later), while these are obvious, what‚Äôs not obvious is timing because of external and internal reasons.

20/04/2020, 20:24 - +91 99305 30939: Not too many people have cards with 3.3% reward rate
20/04/2020, 20:25 - +91 99305 30939: Also HDFC charges redemption charges and its hotel and flight prices are higher compared to other places. So true reward rate is lesser.
20/04/2020, 20:25 - +91 99305 30939: And with Travel gone for next 2 years, I don't know if it's even worth collecting many of those points.
20/04/2020, 20:26 - +91 99305 30939: Since they'll likely expire
20/04/2020, 20:26 - Aayush: True
20/04/2020, 20:26 - Aayush: However that‚Äôs better than buying Yoga videos from YouTube
20/04/2020, 20:27 - Aayush: Relative scale and relative utility of points vs price paid
20/04/2020, 20:29 - +91 99305 30939: If the points are worthless, why pay 1.5% extra
20/04/2020, 20:30 - +91 99305 30939: And there would be tax on this 1.5%
20/04/2020, 20:30 - +91 99305 30939: So true markup would be ~ 1.8%
20/04/2020, 20:30 - Aayush: 30 day liquidity
20/04/2020, 20:30 - Aayush: Perfect timing wise
20/04/2020, 20:31 - Jasnoor Gill: If Your thesis is that travel is worthless for next 2 yrs, then yes, you should not be looking at this option
20/04/2020, 20:31 - Aayush: Should get some traction for sure of course
20/04/2020, 20:31 - +91 99305 30939: Someone with a 3.3% reward rate card (HDFC ones) has to have > 20 lakh salary
20/04/2020, 20:32 - +91 99305 30939: 30 day additional liquidity isn't that big a point for these users
20/04/2020, 20:32 - +91 99870 94433: With redgiraffe, increment is 0.46% including GST
20/04/2020, 20:32 - +91 99305 30939: Yup
20/04/2020, 20:34 - Jasnoor Gill: So it'll win, if they can simplify their flows
20/04/2020, 20:36 - +91 99305 30939: I'd say even Red Girraffe doesn't make sense now. All points that can be used only for travel are worthless
20/04/2020, 20:37 - +91 99305 30939: You're paying 0.46% extra and would get 0 value
20/04/2020, 20:37 - Jasnoor Gill: Ymmv ;) I am hoping things perk up in 12-15 months, but that's me ü§∑

21/04/2020, 16:15 - +91 99020 11644: You can do this via zeppelin

21/04/2020, 16:21 - +91 72591 76020: When I was at YourStory, we got the design team to learn it, we were from the Design team sending PDFs for our sponsored microsites to actual sites. This removed the need of tech team to come in for those projects. 

We even moved the events site to webflow.

21/04/2020, 20:12 - Aayush: Yes no so growth hence firing - all of these are fat places, all founders knew this when they were hiring in the first place
21/04/2020, 20:12 - +91 99375 36453: I remember Grexter and Zolostays ke properties shouting out 90%+ occupancy rate at any given time.
21/04/2020, 20:13 - +91 99375 36453: Makes sense
21/04/2020, 20:13 - Aayush: These places have only 3 kind of non-tech staff - acquisition + maintenance + cs

Requirement for all of them would reduce

+ sales would reduce
21/04/2020, 20:14 - Aayush: (Correct me if am wrong, I think at least couple of people from the category are here in the group for sure)
21/04/2020, 20:14 - Aayush: They should be able to put in a lot more light, unless under obligation of not speaking, like others

22/04/2020, 09:53 - +91 97571 63031: Can someone explain the difference between Jio Platforms and Jio Infocomm? Like which company makes money from my mobile bills?  I am curious if Facebook gets 10% of entire Jio revenue or only from a software subscription platform.
22/04/2020, 10:31 - +91 70328 02600: Reading this - seems like FB will get into SMB biz tools category - may be built over whatsapp. In the same domain as Khatabook
22/04/2020, 10:34 - Preetam Nath: From the TC article:

_One possible collaboration could be, said David Fischer, Chief Revenue Officer at Facebook, and Ajit Mohan, VP and Managing Director of Facebook India, bringing together JioMart, an e-commerce business that is a joint venture between Jio and Reliance Retail (nation‚Äôs largest retail chain), with WhatsApp, which counts India as its biggest market with more than 400 million users._

_‚ÄúWe can enable people to connect with businesses, shop and ultimately purchase products in a seamless mobile experience,‚Äù they said._

22/04/2020, 12:11 - Sankshep Swiggy: What bearing does this deal have on the overall funding landscape... I mean with this kinda money, im sure it lightens up the investor sentiment?
22/04/2020, 12:12 - Sankshep Swiggy: Any insights on this?
22/04/2020, 12:14 - Movin Jain Meesho: On the contrary, I think it has negative implications for startup funding. FB and Reliance might now be able to steamroll quite a few India specific business models that had attracted investor interest in recent months and years. No one knew what the exact business model might be, and everyone was trying their own idea. Given the money FB and Reliance have, even if they don't have the right idea, they can make their business model the right one because of the war chest
22/04/2020, 12:15 - Movin Jain Meesho: Usually a deal of this size brings liquidity, which generally helps investor sentiment. But 6 billion is probably not a needle mover for liquidity when it comes to RIL
22/04/2020, 12:16 - Jasnoor Gill: I doubt it, covid wise short term. At this point, every vc will conserve powder and see how they can help existing investments and which can survive etc. Unless you are a business growing like crazy due to wfh, not much hope this Q.
22/04/2020, 12:16 - Jasnoor Gill: That's assuming multiple people/vcs get Exits and so on.in this case it's just money to ril to retire their debtü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
22/04/2020, 12:17 - Nachi: nope no VCs, banks might get some loans paid off if Mukesh saab wishes it.
22/04/2020, 12:17 - Movin Jain Meesho: agree. none of this money will trickle down to the tech ecosystem. In case of Flipkart, it was a different story
22/04/2020, 12:18 - Nachi: üíØ
22/04/2020, 12:19 - Nachi: funding hasnt stopped, just paused. Logistically, Early stage investors need a lot of in person due dligence. They are not setup to operate remotely. Hence the pauce. Macro level, there is still a good case for new startups to be born now.

22/04/2020, 12:24 - +91 97690 03072: I think - early stage on potentially overlapping businesses will slow
22/04/2020, 12:24 - +91 97690 03072: But later stage will see increments, as funds & companies both work on ensuring they have enough firepower to take on RIL + FB, in whatever form one can.
22/04/2020, 12:25 - +91 97690 03072: One added thing on the early stage is that early-mid stage could become potential M&A targets for FB+RIL, imo.
22/04/2020, 12:25 - +91 97690 03072: Instead of them working on figuring out things from scratch.

22/04/2020, 13:08 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: my idea: For social meetings, love to be able to have "side conversations" where 2-3 folks break from the larger group, decide to chat separately for a bit. Main and side convos can hear the other conversation in "low volume" like in IRL. "Tap on shoulder" to pull in/out of side convos.
22/04/2020, 14:19 - +91 99020 11644: That‚Äôs why we have Unifize @919790987495 üòÄ

22/04/2020, 14:23 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: haha. for live convos Lakshman! i mean like when 10 of us from my group of friends decide to catch up on a zoom session.
22/04/2020, 14:24 - Jasnoor Gill: Well, the Indian govt isn't funding anyone. They want a working solution at that annual cost

22/04/2020, 14:29 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: yeah, but very different from being able to pull yourself and 2 specific other people into a side convo at your will, and then come back to the larger convo. break out is more for a conference / online event type use case i feel.

22/04/2020, 15:30 - +91 77618 44042: I am genuinely surprised by Indian investment community‚Äôs appetite for foreign investment to stir up the market and develop new product plays, while shooting down ideas that may have been pitched to do the same before.

22/04/2020, 20:33 - +91 96633 75213: Eventually we agreed on a policy where whenever we want to do user research remotely, we have to ask for user consent at that time for their contact details for the purposes of feedback and delete it after 15 days from our system.

22/04/2020, 21:33 - Anuj Gupta: There is a trick question regarding the great firewall of China: Due to the firewall, China has been forced to innovate it's own homegrown alternatives, e.g. Baidu and Wechat. Over time, these have become sophisticated to the point that instead of being "importing" US-based solutions and this being geopolitically dependent on them, China is now exporting these platforms - successfully. So was the great firewall necessarily bad for China?

22/04/2020, 21:38 - Aayush: It was bad for 95% Chinese by great for the other 5% who own them / get employed because of them / use it for propaganda
22/04/2020, 21:40 - Anuj Gupta: Doesn't this contradict your stance when it comes to the rest of the world, i.e. "capitalists are the best socialists"? Replace "internet access" with "economic access".

This is a free-to-use, globally accessible, clincal service for any frontline medical worker. This product actually helps doctor save lives and has contributed to 100+ critical cardiac patients in last 6 days.

I need help in reaching out to doctors who are working in nursing homes/ hospitals & attending patients with cardiac ailments.

Sadly, Modi had to turn up as a guest speaker and impose his alcohol morality on the crowd, meaning thousands of people from all over the world having to go dry for 2 out of the 3 days (the 3rd day was hosted by the Americans). 

Unaware of this before agreeing to attend, I asked one of the caterers on the first night where the bar was.

‚ÄúSir, this is a respectable crowd,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúso, no alcohol.‚Äù

The point here is this comes right from the top.

23/04/2020, 15:30 - Ankit Pansari: Thank you guys.
23/04/2020, 15:31 - Nachi: i usually find fullstory to be good but very expensive and elit-ish
23/04/2020, 15:31 - Nachi: inspectlet has always been cheaper for me, especially because in also believe in sampling the recordings
23/04/2020, 15:31 - Ankit Pansari: Precisely. Moreover, I don't like products where pricing involves talking to thier sales team.

23/04/2020, 15:50 - +91 99375 36453: I remember @447774406149 talking about some Sci-fi and space related books
23/04/2020, 15:59 - Jincen Matthew: Foundation Trilogy by Isaac Asimov
23/04/2020, 15:59 - Jincen Matthew: Sci-fi genre
23/04/2020, 16:01 - Mayank Berlin: Oh its brilliant. The entire premise of psycho history and the positronic brain was way ahead of its time
23/04/2020, 16:02 - Mayank Berlin: Would recommend I, Robot short stories too
23/04/2020, 16:03 - +91 99375 36453: "I'?

Plans and situated actions
23/04/2020, 16:23 - Nachi: Plans and situated actions by Lucy Suchman
23/04/2020, 16:24 - Nachi: Theory of situated action is a core Human-computer interaction concept. But lucy's book expounds is a classic in this
23/04/2020, 16:24 - Nachi: also the book was originally written in 1987
23/04/2020, 16:26 - Nachi: if things like this interest you, then DM me. There is a treasure trove of research Dr. Suchman did that are relevant to product teams of today.
23/04/2020, 16:32 - +91 99809 65477: Everything by Richard Feynman, Romancing the Balance Sheet by Anil Lamba (not pertinent to my current role, but to the previous one), Homo Deus by Harari, The Greatest Salesman in the World by OG Mandino (preachy but good for mindset. I consider selling to be an integral PM skill).
23/04/2020, 16:33 - Mayank Berlin: Yes please. Can I has a copy? üòá
23/04/2020, 16:34 - Mayank Berlin: And is no one going to recommend Mr N N Taleb? üòÅ

23/04/2020, 16:35 - Aayush: Too mainstream to garner respect from this audience
23/04/2020, 16:35 - Aayush: One might say, not black swan enough
23/04/2020, 16:36 - +91 81233 27117: Wait, I used to think everyone but me had a set of Incerto lying around their house.
23/04/2020, 16:36 - Mayank Berlin: Lolz.. Its not as common as you think üòÇ
23/04/2020, 16:37 - +91 81233 27117: Okay I was fooled by randomness on this one

23/04/2020, 16:45 - +91 81233 27117: hahahah! I started getting used to Taleb when I read Skin In The Game and I actually had a copy of Black Swan on my shelf which I had not read then. That made me an IYI for some time.
23/04/2020, 16:49 - Ankit Pansari: This is a lethal recommendation. For a better part of my early 20's Ayn Rand screwed up my mind.
23/04/2020, 16:49 - Ankit Pansari: Beware of Ayn Rand :)
23/04/2020, 16:49 - Nachi: + üíØ

23/04/2020, 16:52 - Nachi: its the repackaging, if Nietzche was cocaine, Ayn Rand is the original Coca Cola

has anyone set up a data warehouse? 
Do you know if you can then use that warehouse as a ‚Äúsource‚Äù in Segment? 
Sorry ... noob question here, just trying to plan for our data flows for the future
24/04/2020, 12:17 - Nachi: weird phrasing of question. are you asking if the dataflow is two way.
24/04/2020, 12:18 - Nachi: i have setup segment but usually segment sends the data to the warehouse as a destination.
24/04/2020, 12:18 - Adam Walker: Yes. I self-identified as a ‚Äúnoob‚Äù.
24/04/2020, 12:19 - Adam Walker: Yeah. Two way with a warehouse. 
Cause obviously I want to use that attribute/behavioral data in my stack
24/04/2020, 12:19 - Adam Walker: Like that‚Äôs the point of Segment!
24/04/2020, 12:19 - Nachi: its a bit tricky but definitely possible to implement with segement
24/04/2020, 12:20 - Nachi: Search for Data loading using segment, they allow you to do that
24/04/2020, 12:20 - Nachi: one thats done, you can use the segment sdk or javascript to pull customer dta
24/04/2020, 12:21 - Nachi: if not javascript you have to invest time and money into ETL tools
24/04/2020, 12:21 - +91 72591 76020: don't see a warehouse as a source on their page
24/04/2020, 12:21 - Nachi: i hope this is close to what you are looking for?
24/04/2020, 12:21 - +91 72591 76020: why do you need a warehouse as a source?
24/04/2020, 12:21 - +91 72591 76020: (curious)
24/04/2020, 12:35 - Adam Walker: So I can store and later use user attributes and behavior data

24/04/2020, 22:58 - +91 91080 14100: What's it ? #supplysidePM
24/04/2020, 23:04 - +91 6361 304 501: Driver calls me at the restaurant and says the restaurant is not registering the order. Asks for my mobile number and says I‚Äôll get an OTP. Calls back a few minutes later and tells me that there seems to be a system problem but that it‚Äôs okay because he can take the order ‚Äòmanually‚Äô and I can pay in cash or Google Pay. I say this is a scam and he says ‚ÄúNot like that sir.‚Äù  Hangs up the phone and delivers the order five minutes later.
24/04/2020, 23:05 - +91 6361 304 501: I then spend 30 minutes on the infuriating chat system at Swiggy being bot messaged.
24/04/2020, 23:06 - +91 6361 304 501: He was very clever. He wanted the OTP but called it the ‚Äòorder number‚Äô and told me the order number I gave him was wrong.
24/04/2020, 23:06 - +91 6361 304 501: Asked me to wait for the ‚Äòorder number‚Äô (ie the OTP) and then called back to get that
24/04/2020, 23:07 - +91 6361 304 501: He made a mistake though by not calling me back on the mobile he asked for (he used the Swiggy number), so all these calls are presumably being recorded
24/04/2020, 23:08 - +91 6361 304 501: Order #70817306966
24/04/2020, 23:31 - +91 99020 11644: This happened to me just before lockdown
24/04/2020, 23:31 - +91 99020 11644: After much argument Swiggy agreed to change the driver.
24/04/2020, 23:53 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: he also had much more details about you. An otp in itself cannot initiate a fraud. For upi pin is required. If he was trying to enroll your bank app then it may be possible. What data was leaked. I think better for you to ask for a change of all your cards. Just in case your data was leaked.

Swiggy should check what data it shares to its delivery and to the restaurants.
24/04/2020, 23:57 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: A call center must be mandated by government after x crores of turnover
24/04/2020, 23:58 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: If that person asked for otp and delivered it could have been more serious in terms of safety. What if you got into an argument with this guy when he delivered

25/04/2020, 00:16 - +91 6361 304 501: I assume it was for order cancellation. I balked at this point exactly!
25/04/2020, 00:44 - Aayush: Yep

25/04/2020, 11:56 - +91 98909 99199: Very clever. Time has come for the OTP senders to also briefly put OTP purpose in the message, like *OTP for - Password reset, Fund transfer, New registration, Order cancellation...*

25/04/2020, 12:45 - +91 97437 82962: Though to me the product focus seems to be different,. But it is the same target segment with overlapping functionalities. 
Going to be tough for them to stand against such a big competitor.
25/04/2020, 12:49 - +91 99375 36453: Khatabook will get acquired.
25/04/2020, 12:49 - +91 99375 36453: Because of this.
25/04/2020, 12:52 - +91 93807 40700: Lol. Me too. @919740980880 what does/doesn't make sense?

25/04/2020, 23:25 - +91 99089 50101: HUL's Lifebuoy did that recently by mentioning some of their competition in their Coronavirus PSA.

26/04/2020, 00:05 - +91 99870 94433: swiggy is, but not pictured as
26/04/2020, 00:07 - +91 99375 36453: On a different note. The pictures depict that Dunzo can do everything that all of these apps (combined) can.

It has presence in all the pictures while other brands keep chaning.
26/04/2020, 00:20 - Aayush: Yes
26/04/2020, 00:21 - Aayush: How is it subtle exactly?
26/04/2020, 00:21 - Aayush: The idea is decent btw, just that it works much better for the context at Lifebuoy
26/04/2020, 00:46 - +91 99870 94433: each of those is a separate ad. if you don't see them together, then it's not obvious no?
26/04/2020, 00:46 - +91 99870 94433: *i assume each of those is a separate ad
26/04/2020, 00:47 - Aayush: They will never be put up separately
26/04/2020, 00:47 - +91 99870 94433: https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/the-mega-jio-facebook-deal-might-have-paytm-quaking-in-its-upi-boots-11587728958399.html Does PayTM have a future? Sorry if this is the wrong thread though.
26/04/2020, 00:48 - +91 99870 94433: i can't attest to that since i didn't see them in situ. maybe who ever first posted them can confirm.
26/04/2020, 00:48 - +91 99870 94433: or does PayTM become a sorta snapdeal?
26/04/2020, 09:07 - Brijesh Bharadwaj: The one of the key reasons for the campaign becoming viral was us showing everyone. You wouldn't be discussing it here if it was just Dunzo :)

Does anyone on the group have a good suggestion around what workflow or existing tools they can use? They want to see their existing patients, allow them to book slots on calendar and take payments.

26/04/2020, 18:27 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: A general question/suggestion: how do you ensure your todos list keep updated and relevant all the time? 
- which todo/notes keeping app?
- stickey notes on mac/pc?
- write down in notepad?
Which is most effective way?
26/04/2020, 18:33 - Preetam Nath: I use todo lists for things I'll actually do in the near term, aka today.

Anything else becomes a reminder on Google keep for the day/time I need to or plan to do it
26/04/2020, 18:34 - Preetam Nath: Physical notebook works. Piece of paper works. Google keep works. Apple notes works. Tools not the barrier, mindset and approach is
26/04/2020, 18:37 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: How to keep it updated and relevant at all the times?
26/04/2020, 18:38 - Preetam Nath: Delete anything at the end of the day from the list and restart tomorrow. If you didn't do it. It wasn't important enough.

I used to have trouble managing todo lists when I put the "I need to do" and "I want to do" in the same list. 

Need to do always gets done. Want to do wasn't important in the first place.
26/04/2020, 18:38 - +91 81233 27117: Keeping my Todo's relevant all the time is a serious stretch goal for me :P That being said: hooking up Calendar, Trello, Docs/Sheets, Dropbox, Evernote, Todoist and Gmail works. But still have to spend a good amount of time everyday to ensure everything gets carried over elsewhere too. Thinking of hacking Notion and connecting all of the things i use everyday via Zapier next!
26/04/2020, 18:42 - +91 77618 44042: üëåüèª+1

Habit is the hurdle
26/04/2020, 18:46 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Theoretically it make a lot of sense. Practically, I struggle to implement this.
26/04/2020, 18:50 - Preetam Nath: That is the struggle we all face my friend :)
26/04/2020, 18:51 - Preetam Nath: Some choose to resolve conflict internally. No tools required after that.

Some use tools to setup a system that keeps themselves accountable and in check.

Whichever path works for you üò¨
26/04/2020, 18:52 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: üëç
26/04/2020, 19:01 - +91 6361 304 501: I find it way easier to use a calendar
26/04/2020, 19:01 - +91 6361 304 501: Otherwise you don‚Äôt think how long it will take
26/04/2020, 19:48 - Preetam Nath added Akshay Aedula
26/04/2020, 19:40 - Preetam Nath: Conducting some research, would appreciate inputs from product folks who manage web based B2B products :)

Which tools do you use & why for
- crafting in-app user onboarding flows
- sending onboarding or event-driven emails or in-app mesages
- keeping existing users informed & onboarding them to new product features
26/04/2020, 19:42 - Preetam Nath: Context: planning to build a product in this space. Scratch own itch something. Looking for potential users for user interviews

26/04/2020, 22:45 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Since I work on chrome mostly, Papier extension has been helpful in keeping the ToDo in front all the time. So it gets seen and gets updated.
26/04/2020, 22:46 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Whatfix has been helpful. Not using currently tho
26/04/2020, 23:49 - Amit Singh: True that. 
I tried Two Lists on a daily basis for a month and a half this year. https://jamesclear.com/buffett-focus 
Some days felt ecstatic. Got important stuff done. 
Most felt utter crap because I knew better, yet prioritised urgent over important. 
Now I'm not doing it anymore. My days are consumed with urgent tasks which seem unavoidable until I can hire someone to delegate them to.
27/04/2020, 09:47 - Emmanuel: Surge 03
27/04/2020, 09:47 - Emmanuel: https://www.surgeahead.com/startups/#surge-3
27/04/2020, 09:47 - Emmanuel: Congrats Atlan team.
27/04/2020, 09:53 - Preetam Nath: Did you follow-up with yourself?

As in, did you ask yourself, "why did I prioritise urgent yesterday/today?" and try to drill downt to root cause?

The basis for this is - most people's behaviours have a simple switch based on a deeply buried way of thinking.

For example, the principle of duality has made it very clear for me to approach any Yes/No tasks.

Example - did I exercise? Yes/no

In other words - I either exercises, or I didn't. There's nothing in between, it's a 0 or 1 state

In your context - I either did my important tasks, or I didn't. Urgent tasks, YouTube reddit WhatsApp TikTok etc are not part of the equation

(Idk if I imparted the idea well enough, but if I did, I hope it takes root and helps you the way it helped me)
27/04/2020, 10:43 - Preetam Nath: Hey all. How do you go about building your company website and blog and ensuring that technical SEO is taken care of? 

Requirement
- build website & blog without (or minimum) developer resources
- minimum required technical SEO that one should setup/take care of
- CMS 

The website pages/blog will be the primary source of customer acquisition. Looking for pointers/guides on what's the level of technical SEO to maintain, assuming our primary focus will be on written content
27/04/2020, 10:44 - Preetam Nath: I know Wordpress exists, but man just the number of things that need to be figured out to have your site running optimally is scary. If there's a guide that answers all important questions from "I want to build my site using Wordpress" to "Now it's ready to go live", kindly do share
27/04/2020, 10:54 - Nachi: following to see if there is a easier or better way
27/04/2020, 10:55 - Nachi: currently webflow for site, and upwork for SEO optimization. All hiring freelancers and managing it
27/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 99809 65477: Webflow is very SEO friendly. With the right top down design and meta tags, it might be the right balance between customisability and speed of development.
27/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 99809 65477: If it's a site you expect to make changes to often, they have a CMS plan
27/04/2020, 11:11 - +91 72591 76020: Focus on content and content distribution. Most tools are good enough wrt seo, but content matters. Also focus on topic rather than keywords. Pages can rank for words not in the article. 

Make sure site is fast and mobile friendly: gtmetrics and google‚Äôs page speed insights are good tools there

Use any basic seo audit tools to make sure you are using proper heading 

If possible categorise and tag content for humans 

Make sure you are using google search console to measure search performance 

You can use semrush for starting rank tracking or @919766149326 ‚Äòs rankzio

Remember outside google and your first part data, everything else is a signal and not a metric
27/04/2020, 11:14 - +91 72591 76020: More importantly .. what is good for humans will be google for seo. My opinion always has been that google‚Äôs seo rules are a lagging indicator for human behaviour.
27/04/2020, 11:14 - Nachi: @917259176020  good point, but more often than not as a startup we are playing catch up with googles algorithm
27/04/2020, 11:14 - +91 72591 76020: For eg, if you have clickbaity headlines your bounce will be high
27/04/2020, 11:15 - Nachi: despite having good human optimized content, it helps to make sure to "know the rules" and "play by them"
27/04/2020, 11:16 - +91 72591 76020: It can get really complex if content is bad :), but if your content strategy overall is good, your organic traffic will increase.
27/04/2020, 11:17 - +91 72591 76020: And even big companies do dabble in the dark arts or seo
27/04/2020, 11:18 - +91 72591 76020: If you are small.. leverage social and smaller channels like hackernews, LinkedIn, Indihackers
27/04/2020, 11:18 - Nachi: You are referring to Content Sprinkling, which is a good early strategy
27/04/2020, 11:18 - Nachi: but at scale, there is still need to adhere to some deep basics
27/04/2020, 11:19 - Nachi: for example, here is an audit i got done a while back.
27/04/2020, 11:19 - Nachi: <Media omitted>
27/04/2020, 11:19 - Nachi: as you see, there are much more to it than that meets the eye
27/04/2020, 11:20 - Nachi: after making the recommended changes we say a 177% lift on existing content and page views
27/04/2020, 11:20 - Nachi: *saw
27/04/2020, 11:20 - Preetam Nath: ^^that's exactly what I was referring to. Is there a system that takes care of all technical SEO elements? Or is there no way to do this except a custom job
27/04/2020, 11:20 - Preetam Nath: Also @918778164531 all this was implemented on your Webflow site?
27/04/2020, 11:20 - +91 97690 03072: Does this document have specifics to your business, or (also) has some overall specs and guidelines on each of the points?
27/04/2020, 11:21 - Nachi: yes and no
27/04/2020, 11:21 - Nachi: 75% on webflow
27/04/2020, 11:21 - Nachi: and 25% custom because they were app level changes
27/04/2020, 11:21 - Nachi: 75% was landing pages,blogs, public pages
27/04/2020, 11:21 - +91 99375 36453: +1
27/04/2020, 11:21 - Preetam Nath: Got it. That's the use case I'm enquiring about
27/04/2020, 11:22 - Preetam Nath: if you don't mind sharing, what was the budget for the SEO optimisation freelancers?
27/04/2020, 11:22 - Nachi: not that i am aware of, it was all custom. I paid higher close to USD 7K for doing ongoing SEO specific to the business
27/04/2020, 11:22 - Preetam Nath: Thanks for sharing. Phew.
27/04/2020, 11:22 - Nachi: I was in the AI domain, so it was fairly easy about 2 years back.
27/04/2020, 11:23 - Nachi: The consultant was very meticulous, every quarter he would recommend content we could write about that was closer to the search traffic we wanted to capture
27/04/2020, 11:23 - Kumar Aakash: @919766149326 can‚Äôt such audit be productised ?
27/04/2020, 11:24 - Preetam Nath: I'm wondering, is there not a productized version of all this? Website/page builder + guides that help one setup all the essentials so that you can focus more on keyword research and content creation
27/04/2020, 11:24 - Nachi: people have built DIY tools, i dont know if there are anything beyond them
27/04/2020, 11:24 - Preetam Nath: This message was deleted
27/04/2020, 11:25 - Preetam Nath: +1 @919766149326 would love to hear your methodology and recommendations here
27/04/2020, 11:26 - Nachi: most of them are overall guidelines, customized to my needs of the time. Like what kinda lift i wanted, what stage of growth i was in and domain.
27/04/2020, 11:27 - Nachi: they benchmarked my site using commonly available tools, then pointed at the SEO debts, the recommendations were sorta personalized
27/04/2020, 11:28 - Nachi: it is possible to get a non personazed report, but i didnt opt for that since i weighed the cost benefit.
27/04/2020, 11:28 - +91 99375 36453: I know a friend who's trying to build one
27/04/2020, 11:28 - +91 97690 03072: Understood.
27/04/2020, 11:28 - Preetam Nath: Got it. Do you mind sharing the name of the tools that were used for the audit?
27/04/2020, 11:28 - Nachi: dont recall fully
27/04/2020, 11:28 - Nachi: i think semrush and ahrefs were definitely there
27/04/2020, 11:29 - Nachi: i remember similarweb seemed exciting but it didnt have much utility
27/04/2020, 11:29 - Nachi: for speed and mobile insights: LIghthouse by Google all the way

You were added on recco of Jatin. 
Please intro yourself, read group description for details.
27/04/2020, 16:41 - Preetam Nath: <Media omitted>
27/04/2020, 16:50 - Aamna Khan: This looks interesting? Is the person who runs this on this group?
27/04/2020, 16:51 - +91 99375 36453: Not sure.
27/04/2020, 16:51 - Rushil: Smart. Very hacky
27/04/2020, 16:51 - Aamna Khan: interesting!*
27/04/2020, 16:54 - +91 99806 19723: Shouldn‚Äôt anyone with a whatsapp business account be able to build this experience?
27/04/2020, 16:55 - +91 99806 19723: Anyone here with one? What are the deeper integrations that reliance is doing?
27/04/2020, 16:58 - +91 99160 55322: I guess anyone should be able to build the current flow.
27/04/2020, 16:59 - +91 99160 55322: No clue on the deeper integrations though. Would probably be something tp do with the catalogues.
27/04/2020, 17:00 - Aayush: That‚Äôs the point
27/04/2020, 17:00 - Aayush: I think Facebook commerce will full-fledged start in India by next year
27/04/2020, 17:01 - Aayush: People should be able to choose / order / deliver from WhatsApp interface.

If anything has a chance of becoming a super app, it‚Äôs perhaps WhatsApp in India, definitely not PayTM.
27/04/2020, 17:10 - +91 99089 50101: Good staging ground for WeChat like mini-apps.
27/04/2020, 17:10 - +91 70328 02600: Have built flows on whatsapp business before. What they are showing in this article is possible through current whatsapp business facilities
27/04/2020, 17:11 - +91 70328 02600: I don't think they have surfaced any deeper integrations yet
27/04/2020, 17:42 - Aayush: <Media omitted>
27/04/2020, 17:49 - +91 99375 36453: Integrated with Amazon ye UI looks pretty similar?
27/04/2020, 17:49 - Preetam Nath: <Media omitted>
27/04/2020, 17:50 - Preetam Nath: Interesting. No Amazon results
27/04/2020, 17:50 - +91 99375 36453: Notice the auto fitler on top left. "Your location":)
27/04/2020, 17:50 - Preetam Nath: I mean, not a surprise
27/04/2020, 17:51 - Preetam Nath: Oh yeah! Indicates local shopping intent? Or perhaps based on deliverability of a product, only show relevant results
27/04/2020, 17:51 - +91 96202 06090: Don't be evil :)
27/04/2020, 17:52 - Preetam Nath: The good guys :P
27/04/2020, 17:53 - +91 70328 02600: So, amazon will be stopping showing Google ads now :_
27/04/2020, 17:53 - +91 70328 02600: Though they still rank top with SEO
27/04/2020, 17:55 - +91 77618 44042: Very clever! Google search was becoming obsolete for b2c search. most people would search straight off in flipkart or amazon. 

They should make this a default view for ecomm products. I'd use this only üòÄ
27/04/2020, 17:57 - +91 99375 36453: Yes.
27/04/2020, 18:21 - Preetam Nath: @all

Are you using screenshots and screen recordings for asynchronous communication with team members?

Example 
- sharing a screen recording, maybe with annotations and voice over
- or am annotated screenshot

If yes, what tools are you using to achieve this?
27/04/2020, 18:22 - Preetam Nath: Exploring this space and intend to build a product based on research results
27/04/2020, 18:23 - +91 77618 44042: Cloudapp on Mac is great
27/04/2020, 18:23 - Preetam Nath: DMing for follow up questions
27/04/2020, 18:23 - +91 88618 77706: Yes.

Screenshot - basic device functionality

Mobile recording: XRecorder
Desktop: mostly show it on zoom and don't record
27/04/2020, 18:24 - +91 88618 77706: I use Preview on Mac to highlight areas/touchpoints on screenshot
27/04/2020, 18:24 - Preetam Nath: Preview on Mac has annotation features?
27/04/2020, 18:25 - Preetam Nath: Zoom would be sync communications, i.e all parties have to be online

Do you also use video for async comma?
27/04/2020, 18:26 - +91 88618 77706: Nope, not that I'm aware of.
27/04/2020, 18:28 - Preetam Nath: DMing for follow up
27/04/2020, 18:28 - Jasnoor Gill: Was using Jing, now on lightshot
27/04/2020, 18:30 - +91 99305 30939: Loom
27/04/2020, 18:30 - +91 98184 17804: Loom
27/04/2020, 18:30 - +91 98184 17804: its probably best use case for this. ironically i was just going to do the same thing so i was just finding my loom login
27/04/2020, 18:34 - Preetam Nath: DMing for follow up
27/04/2020, 18:36 - Preetam Nath: Could you elaborate? Best use case for?
27/04/2020, 18:37 - +91 97571 63031: Use Loom extensively. Recently, our task management app Clickup built a screen recording feature as a part of the app. So relying more heavily on the Clickup feature over using yet another software.
27/04/2020, 18:38 - Preetam Nath: Have my eyes on Clickup. DMing for followup
27/04/2020, 18:38 - +91 99725 24886: Skitch for screenshots. Loom for video.
27/04/2020, 18:41 - Preetam Nath: DMing
27/04/2020, 18:49 - +91 99305 30939: Is Skitch still around? I thought it was shut down
27/04/2020, 18:50 - +91 99305 30939: I can't find it on Play Store too
27/04/2020, 18:59 - Preetam Nath: Thank you everyone for your help and awesomeness. Got great feedback!
27/04/2020, 19:00 - Preetam Nath: If anyone else has experiences to share, kindly do DM me so I can follow up or hop on a Whereby call :)
27/04/2020, 19:05 - +91 99725 24886: The old apps still work üôÇ
27/04/2020, 20:38 - +91 74171 77927: You can get the APK off repos like this https://www.techspot.com/downloads/5705-skitch.html (works beautifully!)
27/04/2020, 22:00 - +91 96866 27129: Hey guys, any good webinars that you guys have been listening to during the last month? It doesn't have to be product focused. But across the board
27/04/2020, 22:12 - +91 99305 30939: Thanks!

28/04/2020, 07:42 - +91 98190 07259: Does anyone know a locality wise tracker for covid? (Especially Bangalore)
28/04/2020, 09:00 - +91 72591 76020: It is fully integrated in to Evernote
28/04/2020, 09:01 - +91 72591 76020: The BBMP commissioner puts a report on Facebook which has ward wise details

28/04/2020, 10:01 - +91 97437 82962: For Ahmedabad, I can see it on Google maps itself
28/04/2020, 10:12 - +91 98190 07259: What do you search on maps?
28/04/2020, 10:12 - +91 98190 07259: Thanks
28/04/2020, 10:17 - +91 97437 82962: Okay, so AMC has created a map which was shared with me as link by someone. The data is being maintained by AMC.
28/04/2020, 10:17 - +91 98190 07259: Got it. Thanks
28/04/2020, 10:18 - +91 97690 03072: Can you share the link pl. 
if anyone has this for any other cities - do share pl?
28/04/2020, 10:19 - +91 97437 82962: AMC Corona Positive case location

28/04/2020, 10:51 - +91 96866 56459: Everything is just a feature in a super app. Zomato wrote a longform on how they will change the ordering food paradigm in restaurants. And a week later, Paytm is mentioning it will be part of their super app. Scan a QR. Menu appears. You order. Food comes. You pay direct from the app.
28/04/2020, 10:52 - Preetam Nath: @918971402124 brings back memories from our previous startup :D
28/04/2020, 10:52 - Preetam Nath: Bigger question is, would people even go to the store?
28/04/2020, 10:53 - +91 96866 56459: At sometime they will right, Preetham. Maybe not in the near term. But slowly ....
28/04/2020, 10:53 - +91 89714 02124: üòÑ They definitely have time on their side!
28/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 96866 56459: Funda is - when you think about this - you can extrapolate this mechanism to anywhere. In my local kirana, one of the guys comes out, takes down what each person in the queue wants. One by one, we go to the counter, point to our heap of things, pay, put everything in to our bag and come out. Extrapolate the above to here.
28/04/2020, 10:54 - Preetam Nath: Thought exercise:

Assuming conditions change and you're going back to store.

Ask - what conditions changed that you can now risk physical closeness with lots of humans?

If that risk factor has changed, what's the need for a digital menu? Just talk to the waiter!
28/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 97437 82962: The bigger question about these behavioral changes is, are these changes going to be permanent or just temporary till this virus becomes just another flu virus and we have the vaccine for the same?
28/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 96866 56459: True. Its a catch-22. But there might just be a quasi period of time, when, not everyone is vaccinated (or whatever the end game is) - when a subsection of people (bachelors, PG folks, etc) might have to 'risk' to get basic subsistence.
28/04/2020, 10:57 - +91 96866 56459: One thing for sure - is - the awareness of preventing spread of cold/flu will increase ~ aka the Japanese habit (and other SE Asian countries too), of masking even when someone has the slightest of sniffles.
28/04/2020, 10:58 - Preetam Nath: That would be a welcome change. If everyone could cup their face before sneezing, the world will be a better place üòÖ
28/04/2020, 10:59 - +91 97437 82962: true!
there will be increased awareness and self-protection in 'some sections' of the society in India.
28/04/2020, 11:03 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: In either case menu cards are probably filthy enough to warrant change of behavior. Hate touching them. üò¨

28/04/2020, 14:01 - +91 98190 07259: Nice. Thanks for sharing this. Wanted to know whats happening in my locality to decide how to step out after May 3rd
28/04/2020, 15:25 - Mayank Berlin: How to say No. A handy guide with email templates. üòâ https://www.starterstory.com/how-to-say-no
28/04/2020, 15:51 - +91 97418 25657: How do you folks handle offer letters? 

Currently our accounting firm probably uses a template with bunch of copy pasted stuff. 

Who are the right people for it? Startup lawyers or accounting people or probably a SaaS tool. 

Also, would be great if they can give advice on how to build esop pool for employees and equity for key stakeholders.
28/04/2020, 15:56 - +91 77618 44042: Lawyer for sure, maybe an HR function head, but never accountant.
28/04/2020, 16:03 - Aayush: Talk to founders beyond B/C level along with a couple of companies who have expertise in it
28/04/2020, 16:05 - Aayush: However very interested in knowing out of the ordinary answers for ESOP pool question
28/04/2020, 16:08 - Nachi: shameless plug: https://medium.com/accel-india-insights/the-why-what-and-how-of-employee-equity-87bd09bcbe3a
28/04/2020, 16:08 - Nachi: usually your investor will have resources at early stages
28/04/2020, 16:09 - Nachi: in SF, we had an open dropbox folder with resources to do the same. let me see if i can find a similar one for india
28/04/2020, 16:22 - Nikhil Kumar: People function!!!
28/04/2020, 16:23 - Nikhil Kumar: Best is to take help from an external agency who will also act as a trust et al. Learnt about it later, so would advise if you're starting now!
28/04/2020, 16:24 - Aayush: Any recommendations?
28/04/2020, 16:25 - +91 96633 75213: Love it!
28/04/2020, 17:00 - Preetam Nath: a wild Amazon competitor emerges

https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/28/shopify-launches-shop-a-new-mobile-shopping-app/
28/04/2020, 17:01 - Aayush: Expected
28/04/2020, 17:02 - Preetam Nath: Yes it was. In the works since a long time. Interesting implications nonetheless. This + payments (Shop Pay) + Shopify fulfillment network
28/04/2020, 17:02 - +91 97426 08800: Yup. Setting up the distribution network was the early sign of them taking on Amazon.
28/04/2020, 17:05 - Mayank Berlin: üíØ
28/04/2020, 17:07 - Nazz: Does anyone know of a web conferencing platform that emulates the Zoom Breakout rooms feature? We need it for running Incubator workshops but can't use Zoom with govt's incubators
28/04/2020, 17:08 - +91 99375 36453: Go to meeting
28/04/2020, 17:08 - Mayank Berlin: For me the signal was them moving pretty much most of their infra to Google cloud in 2018
28/04/2020, 17:08 - Mayank Berlin: Shopify I meant
28/04/2020, 17:11 - Nazz: You just saved us money and time üôèüèΩ
28/04/2020, 17:12 - +91 99375 36453: Thoda chicken fresh to home kar do
28/04/2020, 17:12 - +91 99375 36453: Coming to that, I was blown away with the level of packaging these guys have done! 3 levels of security
28/04/2020, 17:13 - Nazz: FTH?
28/04/2020, 17:15 - +91 99375 36453: Yes
28/04/2020, 17:17 - Nazz: Last time I ordered it wasn't 3 layers for sure. Must be recent. Good to see safe packaging becoming a focus finally.
28/04/2020, 17:22 - Jasnoor Gill: Have funding? Your vc should be able to help with advice/templates etc
28/04/2020, 17:22 - Jasnoor Gill: Esop pools are a different beast, varies company to company, hints at culture. E.g. 10 vs 20% ;)
28/04/2020, 17:25 - +91 97418 25657: It‚Äôs still bootstrapped
28/04/2020, 17:26 - +91 99978 63008: ESOP policy is defined by lawyer during the first institutional round.
28/04/2020, 17:26 - Aayush: That‚Äôs not true?
28/04/2020, 17:26 - Aayush: Lawyer executed what‚Äôs told, doesn‚Äôt decide
28/04/2020, 17:26 - Nachi: Board does
28/04/2020, 17:27 - Nachi: in most cases, you discuss with the board
28/04/2020, 17:27 - +91 99978 63008: Ok what I meant was. Lawyers helps you draft it. You present to board and they approve.
28/04/2020, 17:27 - Jasnoor Gill: He can give template though. And yes, board decides, most cases what founders think. Might also need to be before funding, esp of hiring employees on promises of equity
28/04/2020, 17:27 - Nachi: yeah, board or atleast lead investor helps
28/04/2020, 17:27 - Aayush: Usually seed guys just enforce a 15% and you negotiate to a 10%
28/04/2020, 17:27 - Nachi: sometimes analysts will do a bunch of legwork if you ask
28/04/2020, 17:27 - +91 99978 63008: +1
28/04/2020, 17:27 - Nachi: nope
28/04/2020, 17:28 - Aayush: This is completely arbit however
28/04/2020, 17:28 - +91 99978 63008: Also +1
28/04/2020, 17:28 - Aayush: And is 100% negotiable and shouldn‚Äôt be decided by the fund at all (pardon my French)
28/04/2020, 17:28 - Jasnoor Gill: It should be a founder driven thingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/04/2020, 17:28 - Aayush: Funds are pretty much only doing it for their reasons mostly
28/04/2020, 17:28 - Nachi: also its the founder/CEOs responsibility to bring it to boards priority
28/04/2020, 17:29 - Nachi: funds will recommend allocating a ESOP pool
28/04/2020, 17:29 - Aayush: Every company‚Äôs ESOP policy should only be a founder‚Äôs call with suggestive input at best from VCs.
28/04/2020, 17:29 - +91 99978 63008: Anyone here from paytm. They might have different views on value of ESOP, given things I heard.
28/04/2020, 17:29 - Jasnoor Gill: Tell us moreüò¨ü§£
28/04/2020, 17:30 - Jasnoor Gill: There are enough horror stories around esops ü§£ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/04/2020, 17:30 - Aayush: They have a different view on everything, which is good, except when it comes to UPI
28/04/2020, 17:30 - Nachi: usually it lands on the founders inexperience or oversight or malice
28/04/2020, 17:31 - Nachi: occam's razor per situation
28/04/2020, 17:31 - Nachi: been on both ends
28/04/2020, 17:31 - Aayush: Can you give us some malice examples?
28/04/2020, 17:31 - Jasnoor Gill: Sure, again, culture is a sign, so is pool size
28/04/2020, 17:31 - Jasnoor Gill: No one talks about those publiclyü§£
28/04/2020, 17:32 - +91 99870 94433: +1
28/04/2020, 17:32 - Aayush: See legally speaking you can draft all ESOP should be proportionate to the overall equity distribution
28/04/2020, 17:32 - Aayush: I am not sure if this is done
28/04/2020, 17:33 - Aayush: If not used should go back to the same proportionate ownership of the company
28/04/2020, 17:33 - Jasnoor Gill: That's always the case
28/04/2020, 17:33 - Jasnoor Gill: https://www.cnet.com/news/zynga-to-employees-give-back-our-stock-or-youll-be-fired/
This was pretty publicüòÅü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/04/2020, 17:34 - Jasnoor Gill: Long long ago of course
28/04/2020, 17:34 - +91 99978 63008: Happens today also.
28/04/2020, 17:34 - +91 99978 63008: üòÅ
28/04/2020, 17:34 - +91 99978 63008: Not sure if it's legal.
28/04/2020, 17:35 - Nachi: "legal"
28/04/2020, 17:35 - Aayush: Oh my
28/04/2020, 17:35 - +91 99020 11644: Are you incorporated in India?
28/04/2020, 17:35 - Nachi: i dont know why everyone seems to assume/presume that there are laws defining ESOPs
28/04/2020, 17:35 - Jasnoor Gill: Everything is legal or can be made so
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Nachi: if you are high enough, rules/laws become guidelines
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Nachi: and most of corp laws atlease in delaware inc is not black and white
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Nachi: its very very grey
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Jasnoor Gill: Been there, seen that. You have no idea how much depends on the morals of the founder. Everything can be adjusted payout wise, doesn't matter who has how much % üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28/04/2020, 17:36 - Nachi: yeah
28/04/2020, 17:37 - +91 99020 11644: That‚Äôs why I was asking. Delaware corp means you can do pretty much what you want
28/04/2020, 17:38 - +91 99978 63008: So you are telling me I should read the fine print of ESOP policy also?
28/04/2020, 17:38 - +91 99978 63008: Hm..
28/04/2020, 17:38 - Nachi: probably scrutinize the founders ethos
28/04/2020, 17:38 - Nachi: i have worked with founders who put employees needs at the board table
28/04/2020, 17:38 - Nachi: and some who dont give a shit
28/04/2020, 17:38 - Aayush: Isn‚Äôt this obvious? Please do. Super important.
28/04/2020, 17:39 - +91 99978 63008: On a seperate note, anyone one from rivigo here?
28/04/2020, 17:39 - Nachi: my 2 cens, not practical
28/04/2020, 17:39 - Nachi: the whole game is rigged against the employee
28/04/2020, 17:39 - Aayush: Agreed but here both founders and VCs are to blame right?
28/04/2020, 17:40 - Nachi: wow! any more loaded questions you have there?
28/04/2020, 17:41 - +91 99978 63008: Yeah I know. Recently got one drafted one and it included clauses I could not have even fathom. Was asking our lawyer is this normal.
28/04/2020, 17:41 - Aayush: Only few more which are important, actual list is endless.
28/04/2020, 17:41 - +91 99978 63008: Need to onboard them as a shipping partner.
28/04/2020, 17:41 - Nachi: cool. i will just ignore that obvious attempt then.
28/04/2020, 17:42 - Aayush: Honestly I am not sure how much of all this is enforceable or why more founders and VCs are not dragged to court (weak laws, yes)
28/04/2020, 17:42 - Jasnoor Gill: Same other places too btw. India might be an exception
28/04/2020, 17:42 - Jasnoor Gill: Because it's all legal usually
28/04/2020, 17:42 - Aayush: But this is obvious right?
I mean even more obvious because we don‚Äôt talk about it.
28/04/2020, 17:42 - Jasnoor Gill: Reading agreement makes no difference, might just indicate how malicious the doc is. In general, unless VP or above, can't negotiate it
28/04/2020, 17:43 - Nachi: it varies case by case
28/04/2020, 17:43 - +91 99978 63008: Yes. But helps you make a decision on joining the Company and if early stage if it's worth taking the pay cut.
28/04/2020, 17:43 - Jasnoor Gill: Vcs usually will rarely be malicious. But generally they'll go along with founder, esp if it won't cost them $
28/04/2020, 17:44 - Jasnoor Gill: Totally
28/04/2020, 17:44 - Nachi: +1
28/04/2020, 17:44 - Jasnoor Gill: Vc won't advocate for employees. Their customer is the founder
28/04/2020, 17:44 - Jasnoor Gill: The founder has to advocate
28/04/2020, 17:44 - Jasnoor Gill: And that is where morals matter
28/04/2020, 17:45 - Aayush: True
28/04/2020, 17:45 - Jasnoor Gill: Seen M&A from the inside. Stories over coffee sometime. Opened my eyes on how much flexibility and control is possible
28/04/2020, 17:45 - +91 99870 94433: customer = founder for all vcs?
28/04/2020, 17:45 - Nachi: <Media omitted>
28/04/2020, 17:46 - Jasnoor Gill: Sure. Also their LPs, but immaterial for this discussion
28/04/2020, 17:46 - +91 99020 11644: üòÇ more like suppliers. Then critical suppliers at some point.
28/04/2020, 17:47 - Arjun Malhotra: Aside from the morals of certain founders or VCs, I found this is to be a relevant view on the discussion. More about how to think about ESOPs as a construct: https://alexdanco.com/2020/03/05/employee-stock-options-free-money-kinda/

Essentially, he argues ESOPs are like an insurance policy:
‚Äì For employees: a small current payout (i.e. discount from CTC) that has a potential of paying off in a big way but not something to be banked on. 
‚Äì For companies: a sort of float of free cash (i.e. cash not paid out in comp) which the company can put to work towards future returns
28/04/2020, 17:48 - Nachi: VCs are sorta clearing house/market place.
28/04/2020, 17:48 - Nachi: source capital, distribute, :P
28/04/2020, 17:48 - Jasnoor Gill: Sure, that's how to think about our
28/04/2020, 17:48 - Jasnoor Gill: *it
28/04/2020, 17:49 - Aayush: I think people get this bit decently enough, just not how to enforce or fairly value it on all three sides
28/04/2020, 17:49 - Jasnoor Gill: It's all theoretical value anyway
28/04/2020, 17:50 - Preetam Nath: Didn't know about this. Disgusting behaviour
28/04/2020, 17:51 - Nachi: oh there are many like this
28/04/2020, 17:51 - Nachi: FB, Uber, WeWork to name the other popular ones
28/04/2020, 17:51 - Jasnoor Gill: Worked there. Exec team also sold before employee lockup expired ü§£
28/04/2020, 17:51 - Jasnoor Gill: Don't think they clawed back
28/04/2020, 17:51 - Nachi: very common actually
28/04/2020, 17:52 - Nachi: they have done similar shitty things, just not as public
28/04/2020, 17:52 - Nachi: for example
FB, retroactively devaleud and removed voting rights of the shares
28/04/2020, 17:52 - Nachi: Uber, before going public forced employees to sell
28/04/2020, 17:52 - Nachi: stories havent come out for... "reasons"
28/04/2020, 17:54 - Preetam Nath: I love capitalism. I hate capitalism
28/04/2020, 17:54 - Nachi: üòÇ

28/04/2020, 17:54 - Nachi: dude! uber's pr is the best in the WORLD
28/04/2020, 17:55 - Aayush: There are PR firms whose only roles involve ensuring everything wrong gets managed
28/04/2020, 17:55 - Nachi: for the shit that happenned there, i am  surprised to see how very little has come out

28/04/2020, 17:58 - Preetam Nath: Question: Was Travis scapegoat so that focus stayed on him?
28/04/2020, 17:58 - Nachi: nope
28/04/2020, 17:58 - Nachi: for the shit travis pulled, he should have been arreested for much much worse things
28/04/2020, 17:59 - Nachi: if you know a former uber employee, ask them about the Travis Thailand pact

28/04/2020, 18:28 - Bosky: Opinionated tip on the esops. Even if founder x gives 25% of their shares to the esop pool, if those are not issued to anyone - technically ownership will still show as x having all. There is merit in making this a big fat number optically if you can get these two clauses: (1) unallocated from x should go back to x. (2) x shoud try to get first right to buy esops from employees/angels. Creating precedence of shares and esops coming back to x will help later. Since x practically will control entire esops rather everyone having a say.
28/04/2020, 18:36 - Jasnoor Gill: Not how it usually works. Founder can get voting rights on pool, but most investors will add clause that in case of exit, unallocated pool gets split proportional to ownership between investors and founders
28/04/2020, 18:36 - Jasnoor Gill: That pretty boilerplate I believe.
28/04/2020, 18:37 - Jasnoor Gill: Same on buying rights, usually it's to company, not to founder
28/04/2020, 18:37 - Kumar Aakash: 1/1000 might not follow this ..super rare .. else unallocated always gets spilt proportional
28/04/2020, 21:15 - +91 97418 25657: Yes, we are incorporated in India. Bootstrapped and decently profitable. Everyone in the company is paid market salary or above. 

However, the company was built by the joint efforts by everyone. So would like to distribute stocks in case of an eventual acquisition or any event. And also I feel when people will have a portion in company in stocks, it would mean more ownership.

However since we aren‚Äôt funded, lot of organisational stuff never happened. 

Primary reason for getting help here was to distribute stocks to key people. Atleast as a written document(revised offer letter) till we are Indian incorporated company.

The plan is to execute this when we incorporate the company in US shortly.

Recommendations for lawyers, esp in SaaS space would be highly recommended.

29/04/2020, 09:22 - Preetam Nath: Secondary implications of Shop app beyond the "obvious" observations

https://twitter.com/kevinyien/status/1255181240472395776?s=09
29/04/2020, 09:25 - +91 97426 08800: Neat. Shopify flywheel is much weaker unless they do massive category expansion no?
29/04/2020, 09:35 - Preetam Nath: Can you explain what to mean by weaker flywheel?
29/04/2020, 09:41 - +91 97426 08800: <Media omitted>
29/04/2020, 09:44 - Preetam Nath: Interesting. Counterpoint would be, you buy from one of the million Shopify powered shops, which you either discover on social media or Google shopping, and then download the Arrive app for package tracking. Now you're in and all future purchases with the same brand are super accessible inside Shop
29/04/2020, 09:45 - Preetam Nath: So while people will be slow to start. As the number of brands tracked inside the Arrive/Shop app increases beyond 1, your retention and therefore starting point for future purchases shifts?
29/04/2020, 10:01 - Mayank Berlin: +1
29/04/2020, 10:38 - +91 70328 02600: How is Shop fundamentally different from Amazon. The only thing I got so far is that they would not show you ads. What else?
29/04/2020, 10:39 - Preetam Nath: @919740545801 care to enlighten us all? :)
29/04/2020, 10:52 - +91 72591 76020: Shop is trying to make the post first purchase experience a more closed environment, and also, more importantly, is the first step in the Aggregator direction. 

They are hoping (and I am guessing), over a period of time, the lower loop becomes much larger and valuable than the open internet loop. Another analogy is the AppStore, but smaller steps, and slightly more open, and probably more benefits to the Seller. (refer image above)

More Customer -> More sales -> More sellers -> More Customers 

With shop they are working on the More Sales piece
29/04/2020, 10:53 - +91 70328 02600: what do you mean by the lower loop?
29/04/2020, 10:54 - +91 72591 76020: lower loop here
29/04/2020, 10:55 - +91 72591 76020: They may also push into the engagement piece for the seller because the app can send push notifications, can host chats with buyers & sellers etc
29/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 70328 02600: Can't a similar lower loop be created for Amazon. Many times even discovery starts on amazon now, at least I do for many things
29/04/2020, 10:56 - +91 70328 02600: Even tracking is on amazon app
29/04/2020, 10:58 - +91 72591 76020: It is already there, the big difference is the seller .. sellers who want direct relationships and what to build a brand use Shopify (but still sell everywhere) .. and push their "site" as their main sales channel

29/04/2020, 17:18 - +91 99375 36453: New. Not sure. Cost for cars are heavy. I'm betting on pre-owned though.
29/04/2020, 17:21 - +91 70328 02600: Yes. Sharing economy is going for a toss -
1. Prefer to eat at restaurant/take away etc. then swiggy
2. Prefer to own car vs Uber/Ola
3. Prefer to own furniture vs Rentomojo/Furlenco
4. Not sure what happens to nestaway/zolostays model
29/04/2020, 18:18 - Aayush: Don‚Äôt think these are true minus point 2 to a certain extent that too for let‚Äôs say 6 months
29/04/2020, 18:22 - Aayush: 1. Eating at a restaurant is massively more risky then ordering in
2. How many people will own cars? What‚Äôs the risk ladder for all commute look like? What‚Äôs the upgrade movement in each segment?
3. What‚Äôs the difference between owned and non-owned furniture if sanitized? Again cumulative customer segment movement
4. Shared stays will have an issue but because of very different reasons - Their model was not priced in correctly when they began their journey for demand and supply curves differentiating, therefore their agreements will have to be massively reworked
29/04/2020, 18:30 - Jasnoor Gill: 2 wheelers will go up more than 4. cheaper, and a good backup to have

29/04/2020, 21:41 - +91 99809 65477: I pay everything online too. Most of my friends do as well. In any case, almost everyone I know claims HRA deduction, so rental income would have to be declared anyway.

Hard to get Google and Apple to agree to force install on existing phones and you can always uninstall it unless they make it a system app, which will be even harder.

TCS has announced that EVEN AFTER Normalcy , they have decided that 75 % of their 4.5 LAKH  workforce will PERMANENTLY WORK FROM HOME / OR ANYWHERE. They plan to move to this work model ( and put the required processes & systems in place)over next 2 years .Thereby they plan to release a huuuuge amount being spent on office building/space/rent, operating , admin & transport costs . They are confident this will become the new normal across board , atleast in the IT & related industry. They expect this will reduce attrition , attract better talent ( especially women who were avoiding work ... ) and people may even settle for lower salaries . Will hugely reduce traffic. People will move out from cities to smaller towns with lesser rents etc etc....   Once someone like TCS goes into this , surely it will snowball.....          A GAME CHANGER with huge implications for the Real Estate, Transport , Hotel / Catering Industries over next couple of years...

01/05/2020, 16:51 - +91 99806 19723: Hi All! Question for Ecommerce PMs: What's the latest flow you employ to capture the user's delivery address. Wanted your take on the flow based on two dimensions 1) Convenience (Map pin drop as a starting point, dropdowns for sub-area selection, etc.) 2) Ensuring Address Accuracy (Pincode validation during the address addition, Lat-Long capture on first delivery, Use of some third-party service like Map My India / Locus for checking address sanctity/cleaning addresses). Are there any novel flows you've seen/employed? Could be from outside e-commerce as well. Thanks!
01/05/2020, 16:51 - Nachi: Why?
01/05/2020, 16:55 - Aayush: Really bad onboarding experience, founders don‚Äôt seem to have a clue about what they are doing - do not answers questions straight, their on website tool is supposedly not working for 30 days according to founders themselves. Not straight forward at all. I have a feeling I know what‚Äôs up because of their tie-ups but this should have come from the founders rather than me second guessing.
01/05/2020, 17:02 - Aayush: The worst case is their insurance providers are changing schemes because of which they are unable to move forward.
The best case is that they completely forgot about customers onboarding even when two co-founders were involved.
Both those cases look bad for a company on which your employees life depends on, literally.
01/05/2020, 17:03 - Aayush: But hoping more product like them or they themselves spruce up, would make insurance at a B2B level much easier

01/05/2020, 20:42 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Marketing gimmick and nothing else
01/05/2020, 20:42 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: You never hug or shake hand with the delivery guy, before taking a delivery anyway

Though Bounce was wicked ride before.

02/05/2020, 18:14 - Jasnoor Gill: I think some companies tried it pre covid. Happychef?
02/05/2020, 18:15 - Jasnoor Gill: Why wouldn't they just order cooked stuff, that's the question
02/05/2020, 18:15 - +91 99870 94433: 'ghar ka khaan' / perceived hygiene
02/05/2020, 18:16 - +91 99870 94433: *khana
02/05/2020, 18:19 - +91 96866 56459: Perceived hygiene. Not trusting restaurant/staff.
02/05/2020, 18:20 - +91 91080 14100: I think all these foodtech side pot bets are funny at best
02/05/2020, 18:20 - +91 99870 94433: main business will anyway do reasonably well now.
02/05/2020, 18:20 - +91 91080 14100: Really

02/05/2020, 18:21 - +91 91080 14100: I think they will degrow massively and have no path to recovery

02/05/2020, 18:21 - +91 99870 94433: people who 'can't' cook will continue to order as before. dine-in for special occasions will be replaced by takeout. net effect should be positive.
02/05/2020, 18:22 - +91 91080 14100: Seems obvious to me that we will all have Maids back into our houses in no time
02/05/2020, 18:22 - +91 99870 94433: just the medium. i know some of the restaurateurs who are doing this.
02/05/2020, 18:23 - +91 91080 14100: I'm not going to click that link, but no way restaurants have enough working capital to fund anything anyway
02/05/2020, 18:23 - +91 99870 94433: thats exactly why they're doing this. they're basically issuing discounted coupons for future dining.
02/05/2020, 18:23 - +91 91080 14100: That's a sign of death if you ask me
02/05/2020, 18:24 - +91 91080 14100: Like what all the OTAs and hotel aggregators are doing
02/05/2020, 18:24 - +91 91080 14100: Ok anyway, I think when all this done, we will treat our personal Blue collar force much better
02/05/2020, 18:24 - +91 99870 94433: house help often work in multiple houses, and live separately. if it's purely a question of hygiene and traceability, they rank very low on the list.
02/05/2020, 18:24 - +91 99870 94433: i hope so!
02/05/2020, 18:25 - +91 91080 14100: Pay them 3x get them to work in one house
02/05/2020, 18:25 - +91 91080 14100: Anyway will cost you one fancy meal equivalent
02/05/2020, 18:25 - +91 91080 14100: Plus cutting veggies seems to be the least of the work
02/05/2020, 18:26 - +91 91080 14100: You have to cook and cook right, clean up
02/05/2020, 18:26 - +91 91080 14100: Maids are indespensable, VC funded takeout services are not

02/05/2020, 18:38 - +91 91080 14100: Ok whatsapp should build native polls

02/05/2020, 18:39 - +91 91080 14100: Not like PMs are some holy grail, but this is probably a diverse enough SEC A audience that I have access to
02/05/2020, 18:44 - Aayush: This is it.
02/05/2020, 18:45 - Aayush: However something tells me Delivery startups are panicking and doing everything under the sun to keep delivery volumes in tact and may end up hurting them in more ways than one
02/05/2020, 18:46 - Aayush: A lot more people now understand that cooking isn‚Äôt rocket science though
02/05/2020, 18:46 - +91 99870 94433: lol its simple af. i began cooking in my teens. but it's still a time cost.

02/05/2020, 19:01 - +91 91080 14100: Ok all these poll sites are shit
02/05/2020, 19:01 - +91 91080 14100: I'll send a Google form, it's much saner
02/05/2020, 19:01 - Aayush: (Exactly)
02/05/2020, 19:02 - +91 96633 75213: Try SurveyMonkey. Pretty good.

02/05/2020, 19:10 - +91 96202 06090: Any 'Applicant tracking system' where I can add recruiters / sourcing consultants with secluded information access?
02/05/2020, 19:11 - Nachi: i think freshteam has it
02/05/2020, 19:24 - +91 81233 27117: TL;DR: 
Price points matter a lot here and those are hard to get to. 
It‚Äôs always a fight between Food safety and Quality.
Too many competitors when you look at it from Jobs to be done perspective. 
You are running a cloud kitchen to make the delivery/ food quality/safety angle work without the margins that come with it. 
Last mile delivery is hard & expensive. 

This is from a perspective of starting a startup from scratch not from doing it as a vertical for an existing startup.
02/05/2020, 19:31 - Deepa Venkatraman: The main advantage is the ability to make the dish without having to buy ingredients that one will rarely/never use again.
02/05/2020, 19:32 - Aayush: I think we can make this very interesting by betting on this
02/05/2020, 19:33 - Aayush: Like with Re 1 / Rs 10 notional value
02/05/2020, 19:34 - Deepa Venkatraman: ?
02/05/2020, 19:35 - Aayush: Will meal kits work, economically speaking, beyond lockdown?
02/05/2020, 19:35 - +91 91080 14100: Ok grand unveil , third time is a charm

02/05/2020, 19:36 - Aayush: I would highly suggest anonymous
02/05/2020, 19:36 - +91 91080 14100: Second, some one DMed me asking why I'm going all The Kenesque, nuclear on Food tech
02/05/2020, 19:36 - +91 91080 14100: And I think the simple answer is this, I couldn't see them making money before.
02/05/2020, 19:36 - +91 91080 14100: The network effects and its implications on efficiency and cost is huge
02/05/2020, 19:37 - +91 91080 14100: With demand going off, and restaurants struggling, I think its a major reset.
02/05/2020, 19:37 - +91 91080 14100: Hence
02/05/2020, 19:37 - +91 91080 14100: Anyway, this was fun, will put out results in at say midnight
02/05/2020, 19:37 - +91 91080 14100: My poll my rules
02/05/2020, 19:38 - +91 91080 14100: Take care and stay safe folks !
02/05/2020, 19:38 - Aayush: Sir aapka sample size kam ho jayega
02/05/2020, 19:38 - Deepa Venkatraman: Not the question I was answering üòâ

Would I buy a meal kit? Yes, as a one-off activity to make a special meal with all the ingredients.

The thesis for meals kits as "better hygiene" is not invalid, but I don't think that will hold. Convenience will win.
02/05/2020, 19:39 - +91 91080 14100: Login to your newsletter subscription email :p
02/05/2020, 19:39 - Aayush: Isn‚Äôt is the same question asked differently with a bigger sample?
02/05/2020, 19:42 - +91 81233 27117: The solution applies to limited set of TG's/Contexts. Add to that habit building/switching is hard and in the event someone does end up learning how to cooking they will probably start experimenting next so ... drop-off's from all ends is fairly probable.
02/05/2020, 19:43 - Aayush: So funnel doesn‚Äôt exist and if funnel exists it‚Äôs too leaky on all front + the economics don‚Äôt work out?

Counter points?
02/05/2020, 19:44 - +91 91080 14100: <Media omitted>
02/05/2020, 21:45 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Interesting questions
02/05/2020, 21:52 - Ujjwal Trivedi: I can only think of perceived hygiene to be the deciding factor. Nothing else makes sense. 

Also may last only for limited time post Covid.
02/05/2020, 22:43 - +91 99809 65477: <Media omitted>
02/05/2020, 23:40 - +91 99870 94433: what newsletter?
03/05/2020, 00:53 - Aayush: Results awaited sir
03/05/2020, 01:44 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: Cloud Kitchens which are unique & exclusive  to the platform are the way forward . There will always be a need for novelty (food is an experience ) . This will allow for the platform to have premium pricing . I see this contributing more than 25% of the overall revenues in the future. 

This novelty along with the long tailed approach of Food Delivery model(Food + Pick/Up Drop + Packed Food + Ready to Cook Food .. etc )  ... when the volumes of scale play out ; they will start getting profitable
03/05/2020, 01:46 - Aayush: This message was deleted
03/05/2020, 01:47 - Aayush: So is delivery a delivery a delivery (of food)?
03/05/2020, 01:47 - Aayush: What about other things in hyperlocal vs not-so-hyper local settings?
03/05/2020, 01:50 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: It doesn‚Äôt really matter . 
When you have a unique proposition & when the volume of scales  play out . The Business will be able to cross-Sell / up-Sell to the same customer . 
‚Äî Here is where the branding + customer satisfaction come in play . 

The above applies for any internet based business which has a delivery enabled model .
03/05/2020, 01:51 - Aayush: What is stopping new players from setting up the same or higher standards?
03/05/2020, 01:52 - Aayush: And what‚Äôs an unique proposition if the proposition isn‚Äôt an IP (has to be what you are saying brand and CS etc)
03/05/2020, 01:52 - Aayush: Which means this is super low margin super high volume game at all time‚Äôs, which either has very high volume or doesn‚Äôt exist at all
03/05/2020, 01:52 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: The Unique proposition / Novelty which has some kind of a Moat or cannot be replicated easily
03/05/2020, 01:53 - Aayush: Yes but that is it for Swiggy / Zomato when it comes to food delivery?
03/05/2020, 01:53 - Aayush: In other words why won‚Äôt Amazon or Jio beat them with more money / more time / more resources?
03/05/2020, 01:53 - Aayush: Or why shouldn‚Äôt BB do food soon?
03/05/2020, 01:54 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: The High Volume is a pre-requisite . If the volumes are not higher you can still be profitable but you should be happy with a good margin with a low market shared
03/05/2020, 01:54 - Aayush: This message was deleted
03/05/2020, 01:54 - Aayush: Why should Fasoos and Ola not compete with Swiggy once they have supposedly established their brands?
03/05/2020, 01:56 - Aayush: So high volume is a pre-requisite, as is understood. Low volume + high profit in food, what‚Äôs an example? Domino‚Äôs yesterday? What else? Fasoos tomorrow?
03/05/2020, 01:56 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: They can provided they have the moat/novelty factor in the services they offer else beating a player which has a huge market share in their own game is difficult . 
Note : It‚Äôs Difficult not impossible
03/05/2020, 01:57 - Aayush: Nobody has any novelty factor in the market whatsoever at the moment
03/05/2020, 01:57 - Aayush: All dreams of novelty factor was blown away by COVID-19 whatever little existed
03/05/2020, 01:58 - Aayush: And it looks like Amazon / Jio / BB will enter
03/05/2020, 01:58 - Aayush: 2020-21 super interesting for food
03/05/2020, 01:58 - Aayush: Can‚Äôt live without it, can‚Äôt live with it, hah
03/05/2020, 01:58 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: That‚Äôs exactly the reason ; why the business with the largest war Chest / market share are the leaders in their categories
03/05/2020, 01:59 - Aayush: True extrapolating that theory, Amazon and Jio should do much better
03/05/2020, 01:59 - Aayush: Can‚Äôt comment on BB
03/05/2020, 02:00 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: True ... 
That‚Äôs why the player who is best able to adapt/innovate will win & This COVID situation also provides an opportunity for new players to enter with a new mind set all together
03/05/2020, 02:01 - Aayush: Yep
03/05/2020, 02:02 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: Amazon can & will enter the Food Delivery segment . 
‚Äî Its a natural extension.

Can‚Äôt comment about Jio yet . It‚Äôs early days but they are in a very good position to choose to focus on any specific vertical/category to dominate
03/05/2020, 02:03 - Aayush: You can‚Äôt do delivery without being in food
03/05/2020, 02:03 - Aayush: And you can‚Äôt sustain with food unless you have at least N% market share
03/05/2020, 02:03 - Aayush: Interesting times
03/05/2020, 02:05 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: Not Necessarily. 
Just think thro‚Äô ... For Amazon it‚Äôs an additional vertical of Buiness that can leverage their already existing logistics / delivery framework .
03/05/2020, 02:07 - Aayush: Contrast Amazon vs BB vs Swiggy
03/05/2020, 02:07 - Aayush: Ideally one wouldn‚Äôt do grocery but has no choice, another wouldn‚Äôt do food but has no choice, another can do without both but is doing both soon.
03/05/2020, 02:08 - Aayush: Lowest cost of continuous supply-demand wheel wins
03/05/2020, 02:09 - Aayush: Add the round raising align with this equation and since nobody wants a down-round, even amidst this crisis, everyone will end up doing everything
03/05/2020, 02:09 - Aayush: A few more players are wild cards
03/05/2020, 02:16 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: Grocery is different beast ; but a player who is already into the delivery Business can leverage upon their logistics /delivery  framework & optimize on it further . 

Regarding everyone doing everything ‚Äî They making the most of the opportunity. Some of them may continue doing it post the COVID situation as well as long as they have something unique innovative up their sleaves  ... else they will roll it back 


The  valuation bit ‚Äî- It‚Äôs is a discussion for another day .
03/05/2020, 02:18 - Aayush: Yes grocery if played ideally is different
03/05/2020, 02:18 - Aayush: If played unideally may not be so different
03/05/2020, 02:19 - Aayush: Where I would agree with your war chest argument
03/05/2020, 08:23 - Preetam Nath: Could anyone connect to founders at WebEngage?
03/05/2020, 08:32 - +91 91080 14100: On the poll  ...
03/05/2020, 08:32 - +91 91080 14100: I have 15 replies
03/05/2020, 08:33 - +91 91080 14100: And suprisingly a few folks who  DMed for results who haven't filled the form
03/05/2020, 08:33 - +91 91080 14100: At 15 data points, it isnt much - I'll send out the results cut to the email ids of folks who replied
03/05/2020, 08:34 - +91 91080 14100: Rather who filled in the survey.
03/05/2020, 08:34 - +91 91080 14100: Thanks this has been semi-fun. Taking an argument to a public forum of similar folks and defending it is fun, must do it more often
03/05/2020, 08:35 - +91 91080 14100: If anyone else wants the results, https://forms.gle/Qvxk5nozh4RrogPR6, and I'll send the results out to anyone who has filled by noon
03/05/2020, 11:04 - Nachi: a goood collection of Product related essays: https://www.sachinrekhi.com/top-resources-for-product-managers
03/05/2020, 11:04 - +91 96202 06090: Nope.. Recruiter 1 can see contact details of profiles uploaded for the opening by recruiter 2.
03/05/2020, 11:06 - Nachi: are both recruiters using the same JD?
03/05/2020, 11:06 - Nachi: i am not an expert but one of our inhouse recruiters helps multiple startups, You might know deeksha.
03/05/2020, 11:06 - Nachi: So mentioned it is possible to set it up that way.
03/05/2020, 14:08 - +91 95602 94942: Just published :  Work in 2030 - 10 predictions : https://twitter.com/pkaura/status/1256857144747601920
03/05/2020, 14:10 - +91 99162 67475: Guys any suggestions on podcasts - business category
03/05/2020, 14:14 - Suhas Motwani PM: Acquired
03/05/2020, 14:15 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Makes sense for 2% of the world
03/05/2020, 14:24 - Aayush: Not surprising hai
03/05/2020, 14:29 - Mayank Berlin: Check out hellofresh
03/05/2020, 14:31 - Mayank Berlin: <Media omitted>
03/05/2020, 14:47 - +91 95602 94942: Agreed happy to get more feedback
03/05/2020, 15:03 - Aayush: https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/major-companies-talking-about-permanent-work-from-home-positions.html
03/05/2020, 15:05 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: I think, most of the Indian companies will be back to normal (pre covid schedule) as soon as this is over
03/05/2020, 15:05 - Aayush: Wanted to confirm this thesis
03/05/2020, 15:06 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: 1.low trust on people
2. For startups - most of the founders want to micro manage (no offence to anyone. Been there done that)
03/05/2020, 15:07 - Aayush: Startups are not even in the larger equation
03/05/2020, 15:07 - Aayush: What they do won‚Äôt affect the larger economy from a volume perspective beyond certain areas
03/05/2020, 15:08 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: I agree and hence added it as a seperate point. On the contrary for point 1,  most of the startups has high trust of employees (being a smaller team)
03/05/2020, 15:08 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Not as soon as it is over. But, yes it will get back to how it was. 

I am avoiding the term 'normal'.
03/05/2020, 15:08 - Aayush: Question is larger IT setups, because normal B2C companies can‚Äôt really do this, normal B2B companies can‚Äôt do this, tech enabled B2B were already work-from-home/cafe/wherever, Banks can‚Äôt do this, so essentially it just about the IT companies?
03/05/2020, 15:09 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: I mean once the covid thing is compelety over.
03/05/2020, 15:10 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: I still believe india will be last to adopt that. Low trust and lower work ethics.
03/05/2020, 15:11 - Aayush: I sort of agree, minus the financial imperative to push cost to employee vs the cost of getting things done faster.
03/05/2020, 15:11 - Aayush: Honestly to me it‚Äôs the financial upside of it that is the bigger reason to think this might happen in IT firms
03/05/2020, 15:12 - Aayush: Pervasive hardware / software solutions to monitor employees already exists, won‚Äôt be a problem to install or work out at all
03/05/2020, 15:12 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Agreed. Post Subprime things took about 2-3 years to recover so we can imagine now.
03/05/2020, 15:14 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Other than IT companies, noone will wait so long. As soon as the govt mandated lockdown is over, most of the corporate will ask the employees to come to office
03/05/2020, 15:14 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Office/field/factories
03/05/2020, 15:17 - Ujjwal Trivedi: In my company about 5% are asking to come to office now. So intent could be both ways.
03/05/2020, 15:19 - Aayush: Of course
03/05/2020, 15:19 - Aayush: Because they will need an upgraded social life and an upgraded facility to work
03/05/2020, 15:20 - Aayush: But this is the same reason and company might want them to work from home
03/05/2020, 15:21 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Agre with that as everyone does not have good work from home conditions. there are a lot of constraints
03/05/2020, 15:22 - Ujjwal Trivedi: <Media omitted>
03/05/2020, 15:23 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Ha ha. Kahani ghar ghar ki üòÇüôà

03/05/2020, 21:27 - Aamna Khan: Does anyone know if Clevertap has a startup program? Pricing isn't available, have to schedule a demo.

Apparently, Curefit has started laying off their trainers from most of the centers and the kind of flak they've invited from the users is truly amazing to see.

Guess, curefit missed asking this question to their users.

"If your cult trainer stopped taking classes, how would you feel?":D
03/05/2020, 22:37 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Oops.

Wait. A lot of "oops" are coming soon..

03/05/2020, 23:48 - Abhishek Dey Hyperverge Product Head: Were you expecting people to say that they would stay back and wait till the vaccines are out?
03/05/2020, 23:58 - Aayush: Ok so the seriousness could be a dampener because of method but otherwise interesting
03/05/2020, 23:59 - Nachi: i wouldnt say this is a survey, its more of a poll
03/05/2020, 23:59 - Nachi: also ost people have a say do conundrum
04/05/2020, 00:02 - Aayush: +1
04/05/2020, 00:03 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: I'd say since these are my closest circles, and the setting was informal, the responses must be pretty honest :)
04/05/2020, 00:03 - Nachi: if you didnt mean that sarcastically
04/05/2020, 00:03 - Nachi: its very unlikely.
04/05/2020, 00:03 - Nachi: it might be the other way round.
04/05/2020, 00:04 - Nachi: regardless of the pool or source of respondents, surveys hve to designed keeping in mind the type of errors and account for it
04/05/2020, 00:04 - Nachi: which includes even little things like phrase and tone of questions
04/05/2020, 00:04 - Nachi: order
04/05/2020, 00:04 - Nachi: type of choices
04/05/2020, 00:04 - Nachi: etc

04/05/2020, 00:05 - Nachi: for example survye doesnt include the option of haircut/mani-pedi
04/05/2020, 00:05 - Nachi: dont yuo think one of the first things one might do after this is personal grooming?
04/05/2020, 00:05 - Nachi: so there are concious and unconcious biases no matter how we slice it
04/05/2020, 00:06 - Nachi: this will make a fun tweet or a post. but the qualitative value is neutral
04/05/2020, 00:06 - +91 81233 27117: Did i just walk into Hacker News or a Whatsapp group?
04/05/2020, 00:07 - Aayush: Like this is a system 1 answering a system 2 question because the setting is that of system 1 but the question is that of system 2

04/05/2020, 00:20 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Btw It was just an open question with no options.
04/05/2020, 00:21 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: What can I say, most of my friends seem to want to step out despite risks ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è But they might not act on this.
04/05/2020, 00:22 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: I collated the answers into categories manually.
04/05/2020, 00:24 - +91 81233 27117: Oh, interesting!
04/05/2020, 00:26 - Aayush: The other way to interpret the question is What is the first thing you do when things are completely back to normal, in which case, the answers are more valid
04/05/2020, 00:26 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: That's exactly what the question was
04/05/2020, 00:29 - +91 81233 27117: I hope Lockdown ending is not the success metric for going back to normal
04/05/2020, 00:37 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Had follow-up conversations with a lot of people, and I'm afraid it does seem like people are seeing end of lockdown as a victory post which they can step out and exercise their freedom.
04/05/2020, 00:38 - Aayush: In which case things are going to take a lot more time for things to become anywhere close to being normal.
04/05/2020, 00:38 - Aayush: Give it 15 days, numbers will rise 10X
04/05/2020, 00:38 - Aayush: People will get it soon enough and you will have lockdown again either by government, or worse, by the consumer themselves.
04/05/2020, 00:41 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Can increase sample size and reduce biases. Anyone wants to help? Just ask this open ended question in your circles and forward your responses to me :) I'll compile.
04/05/2020, 00:43 - Aayush: Will need a little more formal questionnaire
04/05/2020, 00:43 - Aayush: Which we can float to assuage consumer sentiments for broad reasons
04/05/2020, 00:44 - Aayush: Happy to help but only if more people come along to produce and spread such a questionnaire, might end up getting good sample, and decent insights

04/05/2020, 18:57 - Aayush: I don‚Äôt understand why the false vision selling of personal wealth has to do with employee welfare in the manner being sold in India
04/05/2020, 18:58 - Aayush: What‚Äôs even more unfortunate is VC‚Äôs don‚Äôt advise against this at all in no form or manner
04/05/2020, 18:58 - +91 99375 36453: Read that too and it's really really harsh
04/05/2020, 18:58 - Preetam Nath: Because you're labelled if you outright say "I want to make money". The right way to do it is within closed walls, and screwing over your "resources"
04/05/2020, 18:58 - Preetam Nath: *correction -- "human resources"
04/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: This is one the major reasons why that department doesn‚Äôt even exist in most startups in the first place and if it exists is completely toothless both while talent acquisition and retention/layoffs.
04/05/2020, 18:59 - Preetam Nath: Cue - all the "vision to change/empower/drive the world" statements
04/05/2020, 19:00 - Aayush: Well that‚Äôs probably fine for someone who is walking the talk
04/05/2020, 19:00 - Preetam Nath: A friend who got fired in the most unprofessional way told me before leaving - remember, HR is not here to protect you. HR is here to protect the organisation from you.
04/05/2020, 19:01 - Preetam Nath: _finds nobody who is_
04/05/2020, 19:01 - Aayush: This is also why so many employees are so terrified to say the truth or for that matter even contribute to most knowledge sharing forums, unless of course it perhaps builds personal brand for next job
04/05/2020, 19:02 - Aayush: The irony is very inescapable
04/05/2020, 19:02 - Aayush: Sort of even legitimised behaviour
04/05/2020, 19:02 - Preetam Nath: "so terrified to say the truth" completely agree. The only ones who speak truly and freely (the only free humans) are the ones who have FU resources/capital. They don't need someone else's blessing to live
04/05/2020, 19:03 - Preetam Nath: Or someone who has nothing to lose. Same
04/05/2020, 19:05 - Aayush: There are a few but they pretty much live as if they don‚Äôt care and that weirdly helps them keep their sanity, hopefully they even helps keeping their employees sanity.

04/05/2020, 19:06 - Aayush: For most others it‚Äôs laughable though, I mean, only the corporate and personal lawyers of these folks would know the other side of this.
04/05/2020, 19:07 - Aayush: Consulting will do what they are told to do, they are the shoulder from which a gun is fired, the bullet or the gun is not owned by consulting, that is the primary revenue earner. Not correct to blame them. They are in most cases way more saner because of the breadth that they would have seen, if experienced enough.
04/05/2020, 19:17 - +91 99020 11644: Well the numbers lag due to gestation. So more like 3x.

Do any of you use a 'Theme' based Product Roadmap - where you put customer problems in your roadmap rather than a list of features?

05/05/2020, 20:04 - Suumit Shah Rankz: https://twitter.com/searchliaison/status/1257376879172038656

Google has updated their core algo one more time and from my understanding, here are bunch of learnings:

1.Press release links are IMPORTANT!
2.Content quality still doesn't matter as long as your articles are grammatically correct and related to your niche.
3. Google simply doesn't care about funky landing pages - all that matters is BACKLINKS till the point you become an authority

Over 30% keywords jumped from 3/4th page to top 5 for both Khatabook and Invideo in last 12 hours.

Would love to know if you guys have seen any improvement/decline in organic traffic so far?
05/05/2020, 20:28 - +91 70328 02600: QQ : What worked in favour of khatabook & invideo?
05/05/2020, 20:28 - Suumit Shah Rankz: We got bunch of Links from PR from huge magazines
05/05/2020, 20:28 - Suumit Shah Rankz: For Invideo - I think it's just "engagement" factor apart from Links
05/05/2020, 20:32 - Aayush: Both are massively successful in what they do, invideo‚Äôs engagement and organic brand search would also be fairly high in its category
05/05/2020, 20:33 - Aayush: And of course Khatabook has done really well on the PR front and will keep getting mentions in the immediate future as well
05/05/2020, 20:33 - Aayush: Both are well placed to benefit

05/05/2020, 23:13 - Jasnoor Gill: They don't use apple/Google tracking algo. Only apps that do need to abide by the rule
05/05/2020, 23:14 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Misleading title. This only applies to their jointly developed tracking solution.

"Apple and Google, whose operating systems power 99% of smart phones, said last month they would work together to create a system for notifying people who have been near others who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The companies plan to allow only public health authorities to use the technology."
05/05/2020, 23:17 - +91 99305 30939: https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/04/apple-and-google-release-sample-code-and-detailed-policies-for-covid-19-exposure-notification-apps/

"They can‚Äôt access or even seek permission to access a device‚Äôs Location Services, which provides specific geolocation data. Google and Apple note that apps already available from public health authorities that make use of location data will continue to be offered, but that no apps that make use of that info will also have access to the new Exposure Notification API."
05/05/2020, 23:19 - +91 99305 30939: Aarogya Setu is as good as useless on iOS since it won't be able to activate bluetooth in background. 

If it needs access to Exposure Notification API, is it allowed to do that for iOS alone? or it has to implement that in Android too.

06/05/2020, 11:37 - Preetam Nath: Comments are just horror. I understand why, capitalism and individual pursuit. It's an unsustainable model.

Unsustainable = a future where the concentration of capital/resources amongst a few continue to accure

06/05/2020, 11:37 - Nachi: 50% is an optimist estimate

06/05/2020, 11:38 - Nachi: Airlines and hoteling have hard assets. so they are in worser positions
06/05/2020, 11:38 - Nachi: since they have leases to pay
06/05/2020, 11:39 - Nachi: and almost 90% of those industries are leveraged in debt
06/05/2020, 11:40 - +91 98861 70474: downstream effects of this are very scary to think of
06/05/2020, 11:40 - Nachi: Specifically for Travel Aggregators though, they luckily arent that leveraged

06/05/2020, 11:42 - +91 98861 70474: yup definitely - i suppose this was inevitability even in the pre-covid world - investors might probably have pressurised some to consolidate this year

"On April 29, Bajaj Finance, the most sought after name in shadow banking industry till a few weeks back struggled to raise Rs. 200 crores from investors in a bond sale.

If investors were keen, Bajaj wanted to raise as much as Rs. 2,500 crores, but they were not. It was not that in 2016 DHFL had a different DNA that pulled investors in droves, and the Bajaj Finance that raised Rs. 8,500 crores in equity six months back is not worth a loan now."

Bajaj Finance couldn't raise 200 crores debt? How bad are things right now.
06/05/2020, 12:05 - Jasnoor Gill: It's not true btw, click bait journalism
06/05/2020, 12:10 - +91 99305 30939: "Bajaj Finance got only Rs 200 crore out of the Rs 2,500 crore (including greenshoe) it wanted to raise."

06/05/2020, 12:14 - Jasnoor Gill: Ah, since you dont seem to have a deep idea of this market, let me try to explain:

200Cr is prob the initial greenshoe option. The franklin debt blowup caused the debt/corp bond market to blow up when this capital raise was in progress. So debt rates went nuts those 2-3 days. Think of it this way, all of a sudden, people wanted 10-12% when earlier they wanted only 7-8% (example numbers). Realising this, Bajaj did the smart thing and refused to sell bonds at those rates, since they expect rates to normalise in a couple of days once the market calms down, franklin gets cleaned up, SEBI/RBI intervenes etc.
Bajaj Fin long term 10yr debt is still trading at 7.5% or so, so no dearth of lenders to them.
06/05/2020, 12:21 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Thanks. üëå
06/05/2020, 12:45 - +91 99305 30939: Got it.
06/05/2020, 12:47 - +91 99305 30939: But one way or another, the result is that NBFCs still haven't raised all the money they wanted to raise
06/05/2020, 12:47 - +91 99305 30939: FT's turmoil has settled now somewhat - so you think Bajaj can now raise the rest of the amount?
06/05/2020, 12:47 - +44 7774 406149: There is nothing left in Cleartrip to be killed by MMT.
06/05/2020, 12:48 - +44 7774 406149: Not Naspers, Ctrip. Naspers sold their stake to Ctrip last year.
06/05/2020, 12:50 - Jasnoor Gill: Yup, expect them to reraise soon enough. Smaller NBFCs have issues (bajaj is one of the largest by size/growth rate etc), but why wouldnt they. Imagine a smaller NBFC has no borrowers paying them back, have cashflow issues, why would even a buffet fund them when they could go under? Or at least ask for a significant risk premium?
RBIs been trying to solve it by giving banks liquidity at low rates and asking them that the money must compulsarily be lent to NBFCs. Prob wont cover all of them, or the smallest, but thats true otherwise too, survival wise in any industry.
06/05/2020, 12:51 - Jasnoor Gill: Its a banking system problem overall, banks are very very reluctant to lend. More than 8% of their credit capital is parked with RBI, even tho they get very low interest on it.

06/05/2020, 12:56 - +91 88843 00220: üëÜüèº Interesting. We should have this for Roadtax as well.
06/05/2020, 13:23 - +91 98909 99199: How this is going to pan out for the fintech startups who 'already lent'? Most were burning a lot even for giving loans.
06/05/2020, 13:42 - Jasnoor Gill: No risk assessment algorithm factored in a pandemic. So they'll all reduce lending/burn, conserve cash, work to survive. Depending on the segment, targeted, they'll pray that too many borrowers aren't laid off, and everyone will waive off payments, tack on interest, and pray for a quick economic recovery
06/05/2020, 13:45 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: We spoke at length to Zest Money co-founder Priya yesterday, about the state of the digital lending industry amidst Covid. Have compiled all insights here:

https://hyperverge.co/blog/hyperinsights-with-priya-sharma/
06/05/2020, 13:47 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: My biggest takeaway:
Everyone who said "lending is a feature" will now realise it's not.
06/05/2020, 13:53 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Interesting
06/05/2020, 14:35 - Ujjwal Trivedi: The impact also depends on what was the burn about? If it was on Marketing and Reach out (while keeping sane credit policy) it would be less risky even now. 

Those who burnt on frivolous lending will definitely get burnt much more.
06/05/2020, 14:35 - +91 98909 99199: Most fintechs are saying same- change in credit rating algorithms etc. I'm keen to understand about Collections part. Assuming the borrower has limited funds to repay the loans, he will give higher priority to repay Bank > NBFC (physical offices) > Fintech/Digital lender (with almost 0 physical presence).

Anyone here from Collections team/background?
06/05/2020, 14:35 - +91 96112 56611: They marked it unverified on the post now.
06/05/2020, 14:36 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Does zero physical presence collection work?
06/05/2020, 14:37 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: It does if you unethically scrape their contacts and threaten to spread the word about their defaults üôÑ
06/05/2020, 14:39 - +91 98909 99199: It should be. I don't think digital lenders have offices at all locations they lend.
06/05/2020, 14:41 - Ujjwal Trivedi: They have FOS tie-ups usually.
06/05/2020, 14:41 - +91 99375 36453: üò≥üò≥
06/05/2020, 14:55 - +91 99375 36453: Maybe I'm bringing this up again.

But there is something unique happening in the Curefit ecosystem. I have never seen the users flaking a company for for firing their employees.

Curefit says it had paycuts of about 20-30% but, on the other hand, there are videos of team discussions proving 70% cuts across verticals.

Amazing part, their customers are putting these videos up as their instagram stories.

Power of community as a product?

06/05/2020, 15:38 - +91 98186 49039: Yoga trainer at cult is paid just 30k a month? Isn't that low considering that normal gyms would also be paying close to that?
06/05/2020, 15:39 - +91 99375 36453: Normal gyms pay way lesser
06/05/2020, 15:45 - +91 98186 49039: Yes, it's around 20-25k. But I assumed that cult was much more lucrative to trainers than this
06/05/2020, 15:46 - Preetam Nath: Complete post has been removed now. Wow üòÖ

06/05/2020, 17:12 - Aayush: Irrespective of the action you take Curefit‚Äôs valuation will decrease, so will all its fanfare, will have tremendous down stream implications - No one could have planned for this yet it shows vulnerability of startups based on ancillary purchases / discretionary income within the Indian economy
06/05/2020, 17:29 - +91 96633 75213: Monthly revenue=70Cr, interesting that they said that openly

07/05/2020, 18:34 - +91 99375 36453: Where did you see this?
07/05/2020, 18:35 - +91 97571 63031: Didn't they just raise 100mn USD. How can they possibly shit down.
07/05/2020, 18:35 - Uday Product Folks: Trainers I know pinged! So asking!
07/05/2020, 18:36 - +91 97571 63031: Oh, this is interesting. I don't have insider details but the public letter said that all's good.

07/05/2020, 18:36 - +91 99809 65477: Not at all true. Please verify before posting something that drastic.
07/05/2020, 18:37 - Uday Product Folks: Asking
07/05/2020, 18:37 - +91 99375 36453: Bangalore based?
07/05/2020, 18:39 - +91 99809 65477: They're closing centres in small towns which generate 5% of revenue with a high cost base.

 All laid off employees get a hire back promise and about two months of severance pay in addition to health insurance extending beyond their last working day.
07/05/2020, 18:41 - +91 99809 65477: There's also a 2 crore emergency fund which is distributed to people with emergencies. A lot of companies are laying off today. I found these terms to be one of the most thoughtful. Really doesn't justify the flak they're facing, in my opinion.
07/05/2020, 18:46 - +91 99375 36453: This is out in the public
07/05/2020, 18:46 - +91 99375 36453: The article says that 20-30% of salaries are cut for mid level and junior folks
07/05/2020, 18:47 - +91 99375 36453: On the other hand, there are recordings of the calls that put up 70% paycuts
07/05/2020, 18:47 - +91 99375 36453: 13k of 30% of your salary. Whichever is higher is what you get
07/05/2020, 18:47 - +91 99375 36453: This is interesting. More details?

07/05/2020, 18:51 - +91 99375 36453: This is misleading.
07/05/2020, 18:51 - Aayush: Again, I don‚Äôt know why would this also be surprising

07/05/2020, 18:54 - Uday Product Folks: Not bangalore.
07/05/2020, 18:54 - Aayush: It‚Äôs just that people who sign on dotted lines don‚Äôt understand what they are signing on
07/05/2020, 18:55 - Aayush: Both gyms and trainers knew what they were signing on
07/05/2020, 18:55 - Aayush: Or what made them believe some altruistic company is coming to own and give HRX T-shirts for?
07/05/2020, 18:55 - Aayush: Same goes for all employees as well
07/05/2020, 18:56 - Uday Product Folks: Most peoples don‚Äôt. They got a job when they needed one.
07/05/2020, 19:00 - Aayush: Did the apparent business model only get questioned in a black swan event? And if yes then the company is within their rights to exercise extreme steps in extreme situations. Nobody complained when folks got way more salary.
07/05/2020, 19:01 - Aayush: Yeah well now they will
07/05/2020, 19:02 - +91 99375 36453: True for most?
07/05/2020, 19:02 - Aayush: (Yes, that is the point, however in some cases the excess shows up better)

08/05/2020, 10:52 - Preetam Nath: Thanks for this!
08/05/2020, 10:53 - Preetam Nath: Quick question, might sound like a noob sorry

If I have my website built using something like nextjs/Gatsby/Webflow, and my blog using Ghost/WordPress etc.

Does that result in any penalty from SEO point of view? Is this an accepted practice? If not, why should one not do this?
08/05/2020, 11:04 - +91 72591 76020: Only if the tool does not give you access to update meta information, or place in redirects to pages (old pages for eg). One reason why I dislike the base version of wordpress
08/05/2020, 11:08 - +91 72591 76020: also, it is not a penalty, it is more like lack or information
08/05/2020, 11:08 - +91 72591 76020: Of*
08/05/2020, 11:09 - Preetam Nath: Hmm. Got it
08/05/2020, 11:16 - Nachi: not really, as long as your backlinks, sitemap are proper.
08/05/2020, 11:20 - Nachi: a common mistake that hurts SEO is how URl redirection takes place as well.
08/05/2020, 11:21 - Preetam Nath: Url redirection applies when, an old page is moved to a new url?

Or if I switch from using wordpress for my site to Webflow and all the existing links need redirect (even if the url structure is the same)

Or is it both?
08/05/2020, 11:22 - Nachi: mostly the former
08/05/2020, 11:22 - Nachi: url structure needs to be uniform, this is what a bot sees as normal
08/05/2020, 11:23 - Nachi: for example, 
you main website is: www.xyz.com, Blog is: www.xyz.com/blog
post is: www.xyz.com/blog/XXX/post
08/05/2020, 11:24 - Nachi: when you migrate from Wordpress, you will still have to ensure all posts and blogs are unders /blog and /xxx/post
08/05/2020, 11:24 - Nachi: no subdomains or canonical URLs
08/05/2020, 11:25 - Preetam Nath: Got it. That makes sense
08/05/2020, 11:31 - Sankshep Swiggy: +1, bots would be agnostic to what platform you are hosting the blog on so long as hygiene is maintained
08/05/2020, 11:42 - +91 70328 02600: No penalties. Google Spyder don't distinguish based on your underlying stack. They just index what they see. Ghost etc. are pretty optimised for SEO. You can set canonicals, title, metadata etc.
08/05/2020, 11:53 - Preetam Nath: Super..checking out Ghost
08/05/2020, 14:08 - +91 70328 02600: üëç Ghost is pretty good. I run my blog on Ghost. https://blog.pranay01.com

08/05/2020, 16:29 - Nachi: each founder can determine whether to go it alone or get absorbed by google
08/05/2020, 16:29 - Nachi: overall its a validation that india is a very lucrative market
08/05/2020, 16:29 - Nachi: might also impact our GDP growth
08/05/2020, 16:30 - +91 98861 70474: Several indian startups are down right now - relatively speaking. 
Consolidate, Sell, Die would be the only options for some others. 
I'm unsure whether they would have pushed for this if a parallel timeline with no pandemic effects.
08/05/2020, 16:30 - +91 98861 70474: More importantly, why now?
08/05/2020, 16:30 - +91 98861 70474: 100% agree!
08/05/2020, 16:31 - Nachi: lets say google doesnt do this, what would the startups do?
08/05/2020, 16:31 - Nachi: this gives them and the people invested in them a soft exit
08/05/2020, 16:31 - Nachi: now because valuations would be more reasonable
08/05/2020, 16:31 - Aayush: So?
08/05/2020, 16:32 - Nachi: startup valuations were unsustainable to acquire for a public or ebitda sensitive company
08/05/2020, 16:32 - +91 98861 70474: because of this
08/05/2020, 16:32 - Aayush: Let‚Äôs not play VC VC then, make companies with completely owned capital and debt if equity investing seems so tough
08/05/2020, 16:32 - Nachi: speaking from former corp strat experience
08/05/2020, 16:32 - Aayush: +100
08/05/2020, 16:34 - Aayush: Seems the only non-vulture move is when valuations rise without earnings whatsoever and give it away for free till there is a way to justify it, or not, well you wins one or you lose some
08/05/2020, 16:36 - Aayush: Because valuations are low and will be lower, just like you said, like when you or other folks buy equity in a market which you or buyer thinks is underpriced fundamentally or technically or strategically
08/05/2020, 16:36 - +91 98909 99199: Hold on guys. Feb 2017 news üòÖ

08/05/2020, 17:02 - Aayush: Current flavour of purna-swadesi loves distressed assets only
08/05/2020, 17:03 - Aayush: Distressed assets + stressed investors + founders who want to salvage a win = Purna-swadesi tick marks
08/05/2020, 17:07 - +91 77618 44042: I think yes...non-distressed and non-PR accompanied...not enough masala for outrage I guess so it goes unnoticed ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

09/05/2020, 16:00 - Mayank Berlin: Thanks for sharing.. Interesting read on first glance. Would also be useful if you did a deep dive on dunzo
09/05/2020, 16:01 - +91 95609 85630: Hey Mayank, glad you found it interesting! Next in line is Rupeek. But will surely do Dunzo too!
09/05/2020, 16:10 - Mayank Berlin: My aim is more about getting a handle on the hyperlocal phenomena :)
09/05/2020, 17:55 - Nachi: Good effort to publish this. I read it and understood it as much as i can. here are some points i was pondering about
09/05/2020, 17:55 - Nachi: you mention the discounts but are accounting for it as swiggy giving those discounts or eating into their margin
09/05/2020, 17:55 - Nachi: as oppossed to restaurants issuing those discounts
09/05/2020, 17:56 - Nachi: you also havent taken into account the margin in food business
09/05/2020, 17:57 - Nachi: another one: why do 58K orders/hr and 87000 DPs to satisfy them
09/05/2020, 17:57 - Nachi: the 87K seems a bit extreme
09/05/2020, 18:14 - +91 99809 65477: Considering average delivery time to be 30 mins, that's a 75% rate of utilisation. That's amazing.
09/05/2020, 18:15 - +91 99809 65477: Not factoring in shifts, multiple deliveries and sporadic load distribution.
09/05/2020, 18:18 - +91 95609 85630: Swiggy has 210K DPs:

explaining the math on my simple estimation

58K orders/h (uniform dist across 24h), 1 DP --> 2 orders/hr; 1 DP works for 8h
09/05/2020, 18:18 - +91 99809 65477: My bad, that's about 33%. Not sure whether that's good or bad.
09/05/2020, 18:19 - +91 99809 65477: .
09/05/2020, 18:35 - Ankit Pansari: Folks, 

I will like to recommend adding Gautam Shewakramani to the group. 

He was leading Quora product and business growth for India for the last three years.  Before joining Quora, he started AudioCompass, a travel audio guidebook app for international travelers. 

He is pretty active in the India + Bay Area tech ecosystem and has been an angel investor in a few startups, namely Exotel.
09/05/2020, 18:35 - Ankit Pansari: Gautam Shewakramani.vcf (file attached)
09/05/2020, 18:56 - Suhas Motwani PM: Sent invite!
09/05/2020, 19:13 - Aayush: There was an article I had found when I was researching about this a year or so back which sort of the underpinning of all instant delivery products - https://medium.com/@SantanuB/the-leaky-bucket-of-indian-food-delivery-start-ups-2eb1792e890c#.sw5w60frm

Mayank also referred me to the article
09/05/2020, 20:09 - +91 70328 02600: So, does acquisition seem to be the only exit option for Swiggy - as it doesn't seem to be IPO'able - with unit economics in negative terrain? Or is there a path to profitability?
09/05/2020, 20:11 - +91 95609 85630: I think Amazon.
09/05/2020, 20:12 - +91 70328 02600: You mean acquisition by Amazon?
09/05/2020, 20:12 - +91 95609 85630: Yep
09/05/2020, 20:24 - Suhas Motwani PM added +91 98203 02145
09/05/2020, 21:08 - +44 7774 406149: Very well written! Thanks for sharing.

Great move by Zoom, terrible news for Keybase users.
09/05/2020, 22:36 - Ankit Pansari: Welcome Gautam. Please introduce yourself and read group description for details.
09/05/2020, 22:51 - Aayush: Quick Covid-19 Poll: Choose a combination of options within the following with one letter (A/B/C/D/E) and one number (1/2/3/4/5) to complete the sentence

Economy will get back to normalcy only:
A) 24 Months
B) 12 Months
C) 6 Months
D) 3 Months
E) 1 Month
 
After
1) World invests the vaccine
2) World opens up completely
3) Country opens up completely
4) State opens up completely
5) City opens up completely

Like mine is B3 i.e. the economy will get back to normalcy only (B) 12 months after (3) the country opens up.
09/05/2020, 22:52 - Mayank Berlin: B5
09/05/2020, 22:54 - +91 99305 30939: But your B3 option is without a timeline. It doesn't tell us when you think country will open up completely
09/05/2020, 22:54 - Aayush: I agree
09/05/2020, 22:54 - Aayush: That‚Äôs the point
09/05/2020, 22:55 - Aayush: The fact that you can‚Äôt calculate but you know what people think is right acc to them
09/05/2020, 22:55 - +91 99305 30939: B1
09/05/2020, 22:56 - +91 6361 304 501: Where is the option for the economy only getting back to normal in 48 months when everyone who can die from the virus has and 70% of the world has been infected?
09/05/2020, 22:56 - +91 72591 76020: B1... fear will keep spending relatively low is my assumption ... no non essentials
09/05/2020, 22:56 - +91 99305 30939: https://www.upi.com/amp/Top_News/World-News/2020/05/08/South-Korea-sees-new-cluster-of-COVID-19-cases-tied-to-nightclubs/5491588933169/?__twitter_impression=true
09/05/2020, 22:56 - +91 99305 30939: South Korea opened up. But now will have to close again
09/05/2020, 22:56 - Aayush: In the novel you write soon and self-publish for us to read on Amazon
09/05/2020, 22:56 - Aayush: Ok B1
09/05/2020, 22:56 - +91 99305 30939: As Anthony Fauci said, the virus decides the timeline not us.
09/05/2020, 22:58 - +91 99305 30939: So country opening up completely is irrelevant point IMO, if we still don't have a vaccine
09/05/2020, 22:58 - Aayush: I am not even debating after you magically invent the vaccine, who and how you administer a vaccine to 1.3 Bn people
09/05/2020, 22:58 - Aayush: Just trying to understand what people think
09/05/2020, 22:59 - +91 6361 304 501: Sadly Business Insider and hundreds of experts have beaten me to this prediction...maybe I should sue them:  https://www.businessinsider.in/science/news/multiple-experts-say-up-to-70-of-americans-could-be-infected-with-the-coronavirus-and-1-million-could-die-if-no-treatment-is-found-so-people-over-60-should-stay-home-unless-its-critical/articleshow/74619736.cms
09/05/2020, 23:00 - +91 99305 30939: 7bn people
09/05/2020, 23:02 - Anuj Gupta: That would be F6, i.e. Other and Other. But usually giving people those options requires some degree of humility. üòâ
09/05/2020, 23:04 - Aayush: Yes, on that note, assume F6 or G7 is A1 for ease of the poll
09/05/2020, 23:07 - +91 72591 76020: I am more bullish on a speedy administration to 7b people than I am on us finding it in the next 6-12 months
09/05/2020, 23:08 - Aayush: Makes sense
09/05/2020, 23:08 - Aayush: So the point of the poll is not to go into the unknown of the equation
09/05/2020, 23:08 - +91 72591 76020: :)
09/05/2020, 23:11 - +91 99305 30939: We don't have enough vials too though :) https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-glass-vial-shortage-could-delay-global-rollout-2020-5
09/05/2020, 23:13 - Aayush: Yeah, tons of problems, sure
09/05/2020, 23:14 - Aayush: This is assuming problem magically solves and then looking at how people calculate
09/05/2020, 23:16 - Vikas: https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-coronavirus-might-never-have-a-vaccine-just-like-hiv-and-dengue-report/352037
09/05/2020, 23:16 - Vikas: Why is there an assumption that the vaccine can be here in a year given that HIV, dengue don't have one yet
09/05/2020, 23:17 - Aayush: Yeah, reality is it may not ever
09/05/2020, 23:19 - +91 99305 30939: "Ezra Klein
Let me ask a dumb question about vaccines. I see a fair amount of confidence that there will be a vaccine in, say, 18 months. And yet, we‚Äôve not got an HIV-AIDS vaccine. There are a lot of coronaviruses that we‚Äôve wanted vaccines against forever. How likely is it that in two years, 3 billion people have been vaccinated for this effectively?

Bill Gates
Very likely.

Ezra Klein
Why?

Bill Gates
This target is not as difficult as HIV. That is ‚Äî the spike protein isn‚Äôt changing its shape like it is with HIV. And for SARS, we actually did get a vaccine. Then the disease was gone. And so we never did a phase three trial. We even have an antiviral for Ebola."

09/05/2020, 23:37 - +91 98203 02145: Thanks for adding me, Ankit. 

I used to be at Quora - was their first non-US hire, mainly focused on product growth - during my time I helped build out Quora Spaces (Quora's groups/community product), launched Quora in 8 Indian languages, and helped grow usage + engagement in India.. besides product I was involved in many other initiatives - helped build out international sales, community management etc. Before that I was the founder of AudioCompass, a start up focused on providing high quality audio guides, we raised a small round from Blume's Fund I, I stopped working on that business in late 2016 because it wasn't growing as fast as I would've liked.

I have heard a lot about this community and I'm looking forward to contributing to and learning from all of you.

Relevant thread, since we're on the topic
10/05/2020, 11:01 - +91 98186 49039: Hi, im trying to understand metrics, principles and general thought process around building an app focussed on engagement as opposed to transaction ( a la Spotify/Instagram etc ). Can you guys point me in the direction of some great blogs/articles which will help?
10/05/2020, 11:07 - +91 98203 02145: I'm not sure that Spotify counts as 'engagement'; its a subscription product so its just that you've front loaded your 'transaction' and are consuming the 'goods' you purchased over a period of time; i think the social aspect of spotify is probably less important to their engagement - are you looking more at these types of products, or instagram, where there's the social/content element plays an outsized role?
10/05/2020, 11:07 - Nachi: spotify counts.
10/05/2020, 11:08 - Nachi: there are free users of spotify
10/05/2020, 11:08 - Nachi: also if paid, i.e frontloaded transaction according to your message, there is still possible churn
10/05/2020, 11:09 - Nachi: engagement during the consumption period will indicate reduction/risk of churn
10/05/2020, 11:09 - Nachi: so a user coming back to consume value regularly, or product building triggers to do that all attribute to engagement
10/05/2020, 11:11 - Nachi: just thinking out loud
10/05/2020, 11:11 - +91 98203 02145: gotcha, i guess the way i'm thinking about it is that the mental model I use for a product like spotify is different than the model I use for TikTok or instagram or SoundCloud
10/05/2020, 11:11 - Nachi: i take a JTBD approach, and tbh i really dont understand Tiktok as a product
10/05/2020, 11:12 - +91 98186 49039: On your last statement, yes, where the engagement with the key value proposition of the product (non transactional value prop) is the input success metric
10/05/2020, 11:12 - +91 98186 49039: What is JTBD?
10/05/2020, 11:13 - Nachi: jobs to be done
10/05/2020, 11:13 - +44 7774 406149: Jobs to be done : https://hbr.org/2016/09/know-your-customers-jobs-to-be-done
10/05/2020, 11:14 - Nachi: in the spotify example, regardless of solution as user's job to be done is listening to music
10/05/2020, 11:14 - Nachi: could be at work, home, for pleasure etc
10/05/2020, 11:14 - Nachi: so she is hiring a product to do the job
10/05/2020, 11:14 - Nachi: could be radio, an app, or chitrahaar on tv
10/05/2020, 11:15 - Nachi: each solution has its merits and demerits
10/05/2020, 11:15 - Nachi: even in an app, she could hire Youtube or spotify or pandora
10/05/2020, 11:16 - Nachi: so engagement here is how much of her job space (listening to musc) can we occupy
10/05/2020, 11:16 - Nachi: sorry your question got digresed with the debate.
10/05/2020, 11:17 - Nachi: checkout andrew chens blogs on metrics
10/05/2020, 11:17 - Nachi: especially engagement metrics, DAU MAU and Power user curve
10/05/2020, 11:18 - +91 98203 02145: +1
10/05/2020, 11:22 - Nachi: another good resource is by amplitude, if you are willing to put up with a little product plugs, theirs is comprehensive

10/05/2020, 11:33 - +91 98186 49039: Thanks guys. This was really helpful! I will come back at a later point in time with deeper questions on this.

I'm Bhanu, one of the co-founders of https://finshots.in (a daily 3-min newsletter on finance and business news). I did my B.Tech from IIT Roorkee and MBA from IIM Ahmedabad.  

Looking forward to learning from you guys.

10/05/2020, 12:18 - +91 97426 08800: Welcome Bhanu, love Finshots. Great work.

10/05/2020, 12:20 - Manu Jindal: Waiting for your long read on finception as well
10/05/2020, 12:23 - Kumar Rangarajan: We did the same and got 30% discount for 3 months for now. If it's useful can share the gist of how we did this (all on WA since we are still WFH fully. We were honest and he was straight forward about his issues).
10/05/2020, 12:25 - +91 80076 94666: Thank you. So, we are building a product to simplify financial planning for millennials.
10/05/2020, 12:27 - Preetam Nath: Interesting that office real estate owners are being understanding. Good for you guys! I left my house in Bangalore 2 months ago and owner still refuses to return deposit/continues deducting rent. My current house in Hyderabad (where I also don't live, living with family) is owned by a wealthy man living in Switzerland and owning half a dozen other apartments in Hyderabad. When we asked for rent relaxation, he started whining that he needs the money and he has loans to pay.

Gave notice after 4 weeks. Thankfully Hyderabad landlords take 2 months rent as deposit (unlike Bangalore's 10 month nonsense).
10/05/2020, 12:31 - Jasnoor Gill: Ouch. For another friend who owns a showroom (auto related), landlord is refusing to relent as wellü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
10/05/2020, 12:31 - Preetam Nath: I guess it goes down to each individual. The worst of times reveal a human's true nature.

12/05/2020, 09:48 - +91 81233 27117: I used to rely on Fabric dashboard instead of Firebase Analytics precisely because of this. But sadly it‚Äôs gone now :/
12/05/2020, 10:13 - Preetam Nath: @folks

Genuine question to which I simply cannot find proper answers.

If I'm an Indian registered company with a SaaS product and I want to accept payments from a global customer base. What's the best payment gateway available to me?

Stripe entered India beta in 2017 and is still in preview mode. Or is it available to whoever signs up?

Is there a viable option while remaining an Indian registered company? Or is the only path to register a US entity via Stripe Atlas.
12/05/2020, 10:16 - +91 99020 11644: I believe chargebee can solve this problem.
12/05/2020, 10:17 - +91 99020 11644: But I‚Äôm not sure
12/05/2020, 10:18 - +91 99020 11644: And razorpay accepts foreign payments. Have you tried working with them?
12/05/2020, 10:18 - Jasnoor Gill: Why not a US entity yet? Size?
12/05/2020, 10:19 - +91 99020 11644: <Media omitted>
12/05/2020, 10:22 - Preetam Nath: Chargebee isn't a payment gateway
12/05/2020, 10:22 - +91 99020 11644: No I mean they integrate with local payment gateways
12/05/2020, 10:23 - Preetam Nath: It's a 2 person company, maybe we'll hire 4-5 people in next 12 months.

More importantly, why a US entity? Is it mandatory/disadvantages to not being a US entity?
12/05/2020, 10:24 - Preetam Nath: Thanks. Anyone from Razorpay payments side in the group who could answer a few questions? Kindly DM
12/05/2020, 10:26 - Preetam Nath: <Media omitted>
12/05/2020, 10:35 - Sankshep Swiggy: Paypal
12/05/2020, 10:37 - Jasnoor Gill: International stuff would be easier, not having to figure out rbi regs and limited options for everything related to stuff outside India. 
Though 2 person content might be too soon, so yeah, you can wait a bit.
Also, if planning to raise money in future, outside India entity makes that simpler too
12/05/2020, 10:38 - Jasnoor Gill: *startup, not contentü§£
12/05/2020, 10:38 - Preetam Nath: Hmm. Not planning to raise money for as long as possible. Team size won't exceed 6-7 in next 12 months.
12/05/2020, 10:38 - Preetam Nath: Anyone here from Stripe India team? Kindly DM or connect.
12/05/2020, 11:07 - Preetam Nath: Would really like to know if any other SaaS businesses here / know any businesses that have used PayPal. I have honestly not seen any
12/05/2020, 11:14 - +91 70603 34211: Curious to know what worked for you? We too have this inconsistency
12/05/2020, 11:16 - +91 77618 44042: +1 I have this question too!
12/05/2020, 11:22 - +91 99020 11644: Never solved
12/05/2020, 11:22 - +91 99020 11644: So we also started sending emails. This works in some b2b applications.
12/05/2020, 11:27 - Aamna Khan: Bunch of chinese android phones suppress notifications. Hard to get through. Clevertap has push amplication which makes it possible to reach these phones apparently resulting in higher delivery rates.
12/05/2020, 11:28 - +91 96633 75213: Moengage mentioned a similar capability...
12/05/2020, 11:31 - +91 99020 11644: I wonder how that works
12/05/2020, 11:35 - +91 70603 34211: Yes. Oppo & Vivo major culprits on our partner side app.
12/05/2020, 11:37 - Aamna Khan: Best way to get trademark registration done online?
12/05/2020, 12:05 - +91 72591 76020: Pull notifications :) ... basically the client keeps asking the server if there is a new push
12/05/2020, 12:17 - +91 99020 11644: Isn‚Äôt that what FCM does anyway?
12/05/2020, 12:17 - +91 99020 11644: We tried doing that and those Chinese phones kill our app while in the background.
12/05/2020, 12:29 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Anyone running group buying platform here?
12/05/2020, 12:30 - Uday Product Folks: Any good pieces on how Post Co-vid world would be?
12/05/2020, 12:30 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Not a single post but Twitter/medium is the best place to hunt for the threads
12/05/2020, 12:31 - Uday Product Folks: Found a few but looking for something like Mary Meeker report
12/05/2020, 12:32 - +91 99089 50101: There are a few Gartner and Forrester reports/webinars
12/05/2020, 12:34 - Uday Product Folks: found a couple of nice Gartner reports, thanks.
12/05/2020, 12:35 - +91 99089 50101: https://www.gartner.com/en/insights/coronavirus
12/05/2020, 12:46 - +91 72591 76020: Yup, but 1. It is more efficient, 2. It does not get killed by the OS as much.
12/05/2020, 12:47 - +91 99020 11644: Truly shocking that google fcm gets killed more by google android os.
12/05/2020, 12:47 - +91 78480 44885: Same here. Death of fabric gave a lot of sadness
12/05/2020, 12:49 - +91 72591 76020: Btw, at times the network provider is also to blame .. they kill connections. When I was at MoEngage we kept chasing Google saying something is not right, they pushed us off. Later they talked about it at an IO talk blaming the network provider :)

12/05/2020, 13:12 - Nikhil Kumar: Use stripe preetham. Best. Or you can use chargebee.
12/05/2020, 13:12 - Nikhil Kumar: https://stripe.com/en-in/pricing
12/05/2020, 13:13 - Nikhil Kumar: Can help you connect to the stripe India team if you need. Lmk!
12/05/2020, 13:24 - +91 81233 27117: Explore Stripe, Braintree, 2Checkout & others. 

Push for yearly/quarterly payments over monthly payments especially if they want to pay via ACH. 

Depending on where your users are paying you will have to handle VAT/GST. Try to look out for solutions that will either automate this fully or reduce the accounting workload.

Chargebacks are simply too expensive with US/UK banking standards for an Indian company. Try to reduce this from day one. 

Find out if you will need to support ACH/Cheques and keep that in mind when choosing a PG. 

Getting a LLC can sometimes reduce your tax liability and also can help you get better relationships with US/UK banks.
12/05/2020, 13:25 - Uday Product Folks: Paddle also would be a good option to consider.
12/05/2020, 13:26 - +91 81233 27117: Oh yes i totally forgot paddle, if a good chunk of your users are EU/UK based Paddle takes the pain away from calculating and collecting the VAT.
12/05/2020, 13:30 - Uday Product Folks: setting it for a current micro SASS I am working on. Same issues as what @919008767748 mentioned with stripe and the likes :)

12/05/2020, 19:29 - +91 98861 70474: Add to that, Xiaomi. 

All their launchers have a battery optimization function where they kill all background services causing pull mechanisms to fail. One intervention that helped was for the client to detect and prompt the user to selectively turn off battery optimization for our app putting it in a green channel. Despite this, delivery rates are not as great as they are in, say, Samsung. However, user propensity to green channel the app is subjective basis perceived value of the app - this is probably higher in a news / banking app. 

The other mechanic that was played around with was notification priority but Android guidelines govern the usage of this.
12/05/2020, 19:30 - +91 98861 70474: On a different note, anyone who has used / is using mobile app heat map tools, what's your experience? Also, any recommendations apart from Hotjar?

13/05/2020, 04:50 - Deepa Venkatraman: Needed this a few years ago. Stripe had just launched in India and wasn't available. We eventually went with Fastspring (not cheap, only worth it for PoC stage).

The alternative is to incorporate outside India.
13/05/2020, 05:01 - Deepa Venkatraman: The alternative was*...

I guess there aren't that many more options today either.
13/05/2020, 08:05 - Kumar Rangarajan: We did the same in 2013 (use FastSpring). Surprising that this is still a problem in 2020 and seemingly unclear answers. 

Registering in US has its own set of problems (you need to manage the regulatory hassles there too with a CPA and file returns and stuff). 

@Preetham, would love to understand what you finally went with or plan to do? 

The solution for today (collecting money from anywhere in the world for an Indian SaaS company) is worthy of a blog and would be happy to work/help. I think many would like it.
13/05/2020, 08:08 - Preetam Nath: "The solution for today (collecting money from anywhere in the world for an Indian SaaS company) is worthy of a blog and would be happy to work/help. I think many would like it."

I agree. Baffles me that this problem is unsolved, making it easy for 1 person to start a global SaaS from India is just a tiny step in enabling more SaaS and more internet entrepreneurs from the country :)

Based on everyone's recommendations, I am exploring 2 options

1- Stripe India. If anyone has a 1st degree connect with someone in their team who could answer questions, would greatly appreciate it!

2- Paddle
13/05/2020, 08:18 - Kumar Rangarajan: Assume the challenge is not technical but legal. But hope the Stripe/Paddle option is a good answer and more people can use it without having to do tons of confused research. 

Looking forward to hearing how the exploration pans out.
13/05/2020, 08:27 - Aayush: Possibly there could also be lobbying at play, although I hope that‚Äôs not the case
13/05/2020, 08:28 - Preetam Nath: That should be the default starting assumption wherever large $$$ is at play.

13/05/2020, 19:37 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Curious question: What is noteworthy about this post except that it comes from a VC?
13/05/2020, 19:42 - +91 99020 11644: If you‚Äôre a product manager at an early stage company and surrounded by fine advice you get on this group, you may keep doubting that you‚Äôre not doing enough or doing it right. This is reassuring in that perspective.
13/05/2020, 19:48 - +91 97437 82962: This looks like more for founders who mix up things and focus on certain product management principles that won't work for their small start ups.

For example, two years back when I was looking for a new role, I came across a startup which had small number of users visiting their website.
And the founder was stuck on A/B testing for some reason.
I had to help them understand that at such small number of users A/ B testing is not advisable.
13/05/2020, 19:50 - Aayush: Because almost everyone wants money
13/05/2020, 19:51 - Aayush: And anyone who has money is deemed insightful
13/05/2020, 19:54 - Nachi: check out her profile, before VC she used to be a product manager, a good one too.
13/05/2020, 19:55 - Aayush: Wasn‚Äôt being particular
13/05/2020, 19:55 - Ujjwal Trivedi: I know her, and that's why the question
13/05/2020, 19:55 - Aayush: I mean it‚Äôs not a comment on the blog at all
13/05/2020, 19:55 - Nachi: then it was off handed i guess
13/05/2020, 19:56 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Indian VCs need to write more, and more often. :)
13/05/2020, 19:57 - Aayush: I like how polite Ujjwal always is
13/05/2020, 19:58 - Aayush: But it‚Äôs a good question to ask why don‚Äôt they?
13/05/2020, 19:59 - Nikhil Kumar: Writing is hard. Listening to pitches ain that hard.
13/05/2020, 20:01 - +91 6361 304 501: Tom Tunguz and Jason Lemkin do a good job. I‚Äôve told every VC in India I‚Äôve ever met that we need an Indian Tom Tunguz or Jason Lemkin to talk about the virtues of Indian SaaS. They all nod and agree :-)
13/05/2020, 20:09 - +44 7774 406149: And then go back to reading twitter?
13/05/2020, 20:09 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Didn't mean to belittle anyone, i am happy that Indian VCs are opening up and starting to write. I was just trying to understand what makes this so popular other than the fact it is from a VC. I guess people did find it relevant and reassuring.
13/05/2020, 20:25 - +91 6361 304 501: FWIW, it was the only article that I‚Äôve posted anywhere else for quite some time from this group. Before any subsequent comments, I copied it from here and put it on our internal product group. I thought it was brilliant and haven‚Äôt read such good tactical advice on product management for early stage startups. I wish I‚Äôd read this two years ago...it would have eliminated a lot of self doubt!  95%+ of product managers have never successfully gone through this phase, so you almost never find someone who not only has but also is then able to translate that into an insightful, actionable article. I didn‚Äôt know she was a VC, by the way. Just my two cents... :-)

13/05/2020, 22:12 - +91 98186 49039: Domlur/Indiranagar
13/05/2020, 22:13 - +91 99020 11644: Switch to ACT or Spectranet if possible.
13/05/2020, 22:15 - +91 98186 49039: Do these guys take new connections at the moment? Airtel used to be solid before lockdown, I didn't have a single outage in the last two years
13/05/2020, 22:17 - +91 99870 94433: I'm close and i regularly have outages. Been told that my home has copper cabling which often gets cut at the neighbourhood jn.
13/05/2020, 22:17 - +91 99870 94433: Also Airtel. No ACT/Spectra available.
13/05/2020, 22:18 - +91 99020 11644: Yes they are
13/05/2020, 22:18 - +91 98186 49039: Oh. Damn. I did see some potholes dug up near the main road lately.

13/05/2020, 22:20 - +91 99870 94433: Hey anyone know what happened to paper.vc? Not getting their updates, website keeps throwing up errors.
13/05/2020, 22:23 - +91 98186 49039: Thanks, will register a request on their site when the internet comes back and I can load a website on the browser. :(
13/05/2020, 22:26 - +91 6361 304 501: yes it's a nightmare...
13/05/2020, 22:27 - +91 6361 304 501: I have found this useful when the Airtel touch tone system fails too:  http://dialabc.com/s/dtmf1.wav

14/05/2020, 09:05 - +91 93807 40700: But Slides can be made to look good even without other tools. See Sidu's from FoW, which was shared here. Very clean design. Minimal text. Some color.
14/05/2020, 09:06 - +91 93807 40700: Depends on whether the slides need to stand on their own or are a visual aid for a presenter.
14/05/2020, 09:13 - Sankshep Swiggy: Beautiful.ai
14/05/2020, 09:52 - +91 70328 02600: Which tool are you referring to?

Trying to choose between OneLogin and Auth0 for SSO for our customers. Any recommendations?
14/05/2020, 13:32 - +91 81233 27117: Auth0 hands down but would recommend exploring something like a Passportjs
14/05/2020, 13:51 - +91 72591 76020: Admins please add a column in the Airtable sheet for blog url :) then we can go update it
14/05/2020, 13:52 - +91 96633 75213: Similar to ( https://piktochart.com/blog/startup-pitch-decks-what-you-can-learn/ ) , are there examples of good pitch decks categorised based on stage of funding?

For e.g. good examples categorised by incubation, seed stage, series A etc.?
14/05/2020, 13:54 - +91 72591 76020: Not by stage, but sidebean has collated a bunch of posts around pitch decks: https://slidebean.com/blog/startups-pitch-deck-outline

14/05/2020, 14:25 - Nachi: @917259176020  check out ladder of evidenve from NFX. they describe very simply and succintly what investors look for
14/05/2020, 14:25 - Nachi: after PMF you focus on metrics that matter for your business
14/05/2020, 14:25 - Nachi: for which there are enough blogs by jason lemkin andrew chen etv
14/05/2020, 14:25 - Nachi: *etc
14/05/2020, 14:25 - Nachi: my knowledge is pretty limited to product driven businesses
14/05/2020, 14:31 - Jai Quickride: Tech In Asia has recently started a segment where they have collated pitch decks of now popular companies in their early stages. Has 7-8 decks right now.
14/05/2020, 14:50 - +91 96633 75213: Will look into this, thanks.
14/05/2020, 15:08 - +44 7774 406149: do you know of a tool/app (pref free) which can be used to make a floor plan?
14/05/2020, 15:15 - Nachi: check out snaptrude. i can connect you with the founder for accessing their pro version

14/05/2020, 15:31 - +91 99020 11644: You mean like autocad?

14/05/2020, 16:27 - +44 7774 406149: no, something which I can give it to people on ground and they can make it on their own
14/05/2020, 16:28 - Nachi: i think snaptrude will be perfect for this usecase. if they have iPad or a table, its even more suitable
14/05/2020, 16:29 - +44 7774 406149: let me check the pricing and product
14/05/2020, 19:00 - +91 98186 49039: I am getting an Act connection. It's apparently available now in my area, you could check too.
14/05/2020, 19:02 - +91 97690 03072: Koramangala what would you guys recommend?
14/05/2020, 19:04 - Nachi: Spectra and hathaway
14/05/2020, 19:04 - Nachi: i use both
14/05/2020, 19:04 - Nachi: spectra: great speed and value for money
14/05/2020, 19:04 - Nachi: hathaway: Speedy service and uptime
14/05/2020, 19:04 - Nachi: this is 3rd block
14/05/2020, 19:10 - Jasnoor Gill: Airtel fiber has been pretty good for me, so has act
14/05/2020, 19:16 - +91 98186 49039: This week downtime has been more than uptime, I'm simply unable to work :(

14/05/2020, 19:19 - Jasnoor Gill: Area specific disruption I imagine, doesn't mean everyone in blr impacted
14/05/2020, 19:19 - Aamna Khan: Flaky on some days but generally no trouble. Using for 5 years
14/05/2020, 19:19 - Jasnoor Gill: I have had 1 day of downtime in the last yr
14/05/2020, 19:19 - +91 98186 49039: Possible, but not able to get hold of support or any assistance at the moment. Again could be related to lockdown
14/05/2020, 19:20 - +91 98186 49039: Same, last 2 years. But since last two weeks, terrible.
14/05/2020, 19:20 - Jasnoor Gill: Yeah, lockdown is a problem to get support but I imagine everyone is the same. There was an article talking about how service engineers trying to keep infra up were harassed/beaten/equipment trashed during lockdown etc
14/05/2020, 19:20 - Suhas Motwani PM: 4th Block ACT/Airtel works well
14/05/2020, 19:21 - +91 98186 49039: Whoa

14/05/2020, 19:50 - +91 93807 40700: @919818649039 @919769003072 Can try Jio Fiber too, if it is available in your areas. I'm in a different part of town though but just got it today. They are taking new connections and turnaround is pretty quick.
14/05/2020, 19:50 - +91 97690 03072: Oh sweet. They had a website to check availability right. Will check it out.
14/05/2020, 19:50 - +91 93807 40700: Yup they do.
14/05/2020, 19:51 - +91 93807 40700: Time will tell about speeds and cust care. Let's see...

We can define an agenda and nominate someone to talk:).

16/05/2020, 00:21 - +91 99020 11644: @919900707604 Thanks so much for this. I've been struggling with user pilot and appcues for way too long.
16/05/2020, 01:40 - Adam Walker: Totally! The key feature is the two way sync with Segment.  
It means you can do attribution of your onboarding experience. 

I‚Äôm now also using customer.io for email and it provides that same benefit of the two way sync with Segment.
16/05/2020, 01:46 - +91 99020 11644: Yes I noticed that. However in need to upgrade segment beyond free.
16/05/2020, 04:49 - +91 98856 83502: He's not in India though. And he isn't running a consultancy. Perhaps he can help connect.

16/05/2020, 12:25 - +91 99020 11644: I mean they‚Äôre not even out of Beta and valued at $100m?
16/05/2020, 13:17 - Manu Jindal: That's andreessen effect as far as we can see. Hypothetical value ascribed which might become a reality with higher probability as per Horowitz
16/05/2020, 13:39 - Manu Jindal: There was frankly.me on similar lines, right?
16/05/2020, 13:44 - +91 99005 74294: Maybe. I'm just trying to learn more about the product though. I'm a believer in audio apps/ tools but haven't experienced social audio yet.
16/05/2020, 13:46 - +91 99005 74294: I guess that was video. This one is entirely audio. I'm sure they are initially target AirPods wearing crowd in the Bay Area.

Makes very little sense to implement. If companies can't trust their people to be self-starters and get their work done, why hire those people in the first place? It means the company is looking at time spent rather than results achieved. üëéüèº
16/05/2020, 15:51 - Aayush: This is going to become standard practice
16/05/2020, 15:51 - +91 93807 40700: Such monitoring tools are okay for those jobs where time spent is highly correlated with the throughput, where the tasks are more mechanical and do not involve much thought.
16/05/2020, 15:51 - +91 99020 11644: Not sure why this isn‚Äôt better understood. Poor employees. I feel for them.
16/05/2020, 15:51 - Aayush: Ideally yes but who is stopping companies from having outcomes as KPIs and additionally track folks anyway
16/05/2020, 15:54 - +91 93807 40700: Only employees can stop it. Power of community. Nobody really likes being watched or monitored.
16/05/2020, 15:55 - Ankit Pansari: Why do we need a new tool? You can monitor screen time, application usage, browser history by installing a device management agent such as JAMF or Kaseya.
16/05/2020, 15:57 - Ankit Pansari: Ideally, it's not about trusting people.. Its about trusting devices and software they have in place.

17/05/2020, 13:46 - Tejas Singh: Great article. Would be interested to see whether Clubhouse can enable mass adoption of interest-based audio chatrooms in the medium/long-term. Currently, it is an influencer-led network. Motivation to join Clubhouse right now is to participate and listen to an exclusive group of folks from the Tech/VC community. In order to truly solve the liquidity problem, Clubhouse would need a mechanism/product journeys to identify great speakers/contributors beyond these influencers. With Twitter, I can go to someone's timeline and their Tweets to figure out if I find the person interesting/follow-worthy. It's a solve-able problem for Clubhouse but would be interesting to see the product's evolution.
17/05/2020, 14:12 - +91 97571 63031: Not sure if this is true.

"Giphy doesn‚Äôt receive any information about users or even companies using the Giphy for Slack integration, and only sees Slack usage of the Giphy API in aggregate.‚Äù

17/05/2020, 14:24 - +44 7774 406149: 1. Aggregate is a vague term. It could mean knowing search terms but nothing else (which is more than enough to plot a trendine). 2. It can always be changed now.
17/05/2020, 14:25 - +44 7774 406149: To me Clubhouse, looks like another Superhuman. Great product, for a niche. I sincerely hope I am wrong though
17/05/2020, 14:27 - +91 99005 74294: Agree. I guess doing those things with an audio-only platform will be hard but will open up opportunities for their product team to create new user experiences.
17/05/2020, 15:28 - +91 98732 01477: Anyone here who uses webflow? I want a form submission to trigger an email response from my email id.

17/05/2020, 15:42 - +91 95602 94942: Use webflow to connect to integromat/zapier and then route the email via sendgrid account
17/05/2020, 15:48 - +91 98732 01477: Ah! Thanks Puneet. Let me check that out.
17/05/2020, 18:16 - +91 98186 49039: An update on this, I requested an ACT Connection and it was set up the next day. The speeds are ridiculously better in my area compared to airtel. Does anyone know how to disconnect an airtel broadband connection now? Navigated through the IVR for half an hour, and also checked the app. Last time I had done this, I had to go to an airtel store.
17/05/2020, 18:17 - +91 6361 304 501: Haha. ‚ÄúStep into your nearest airtel showroom.‚Äù ü§¨

17/05/2020, 18:21 - +91 98186 49039: I had done this with my idea postpaid in college. I went to the relationship center in Ghaziabad and they told me to go to the one in Delhi to stop the connection. üòÇI obviously stopped paying. Idea continued billing me for next few months. Then they started attempting collection. They started calling my frequently contacted numbers asking for my new contact details (saying there was a courier to be delivered).

17/05/2020, 18:34 - +91 98186 49039: Ah. You mean raise it via email to get the reference number and keep escalating. Got it, will do. Thanks!
17/05/2020, 18:53 - Aayush: Whenever you talk to any CC / CE / CCE / on any medium, ask them to give you a reference ID
17/05/2020, 18:54 - Aayush: And then use that ref ID to escalate the chain progressively higher up every 24 hours
17/05/2020, 18:55 - Aayush: A ref ID from one medium (Phone IVR) can be used to resolve the problem in another medium via escalation (Email)

18/05/2020, 00:49 - +91 97437 82962: That pretty much says they are not expecting any revenue from Paytm money.

18/05/2020, 12:53 - Aayush: What I heard is they are doing few layoffs every day rather than doing in bulk.
18/05/2020, 12:58 - +91 96866 56459: 1100 folks according to entrackr. Including shutting down cloud kitchens. Apparently around 300, they are framing it as performance discussion let-go's.
18/05/2020, 12:59 - Aayush: This is corporate staff in my limited knowledge
18/05/2020, 13:00 - Aayush: This is mostly blue with far fewer management folks within the cloud business
18/05/2020, 13:00 - Aayush: So these seem to be two different things

19/05/2020, 16:03 - Preetam Nath: TikTok is a plague (personal opinion)
19/05/2020, 16:06 - Preetam Nath: (why I say that - TikTok is a net negative to humanity, draining people's time and life in meaningless drivel)
19/05/2020, 16:13 - +91 72591 76020: It is a tool that magnifies human nature :)

19/05/2020, 16:15 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: "In an information-rich world, the wealth of information means a dearth of something else: a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes. What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it." - Herbert Simon
19/05/2020, 16:15 - Preetam Nath: Agreed. Let's build better tools that magnify positive aspects :D
19/05/2020, 16:16 - Preetam Nath: 100% agreed. Managing your attention is a 21st century superpower
19/05/2020, 16:16 - +91 72591 76020: I would love to, but I have given up on larger parts of it :P

19/05/2020, 16:19 - Preetam Nath: ü§£ likewise. I've accepted that I'm not a savior out to better humanity as a whole. 

Although I'll do what I can within my circle of influence. But no preaching. Just doing/by example.
19/05/2020, 16:22 - Preetam Nath: üò™

19/05/2020, 16:26 - +91 94563 18713: Can anyone share/redirect to any human behavioral study around this digital mass behavior? 

People are going crazy on reddit and even 9gag to support it.

In the last few years, there have been multiple such cases which are kind of an attack on digital properties. 

I'm trying to understand can brands deliberately trigger this behaviour to gain an edge over competitors? Thoughts?
19/05/2020, 16:29 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: TikTok is a symptom of a larger problem, I feel it attracts those who are not so fortunate as to have something meaningful to spend time on. Also, I feel it gives an outlet of self-expression to those who are otherwise being rapidly de-humanised by the tech forces that most of us here are part of.

19/05/2020, 16:31 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Most of us here live above the API layer of society. Us making comments about TikTok seems very high-horse to me (including myself) üôÇ
19/05/2020, 16:31 - Preetam Nath: Great point, agreed on it being an outlet of self-expression for them.
19/05/2020, 16:32 - Vikas: Heirarchy of needs
19/05/2020, 16:32 - Vikas: Not Just self expression, pride/appreciation is core
19/05/2020, 16:51 - Uday Product Folks: Very patronising to say the users  of tik tok don‚Äôt have something meaningful to spend time on.

19/05/2020, 17:26 - +91 81056 00720: how is consuming anything for entertainment sake negative to humanity? tiktok is just another channel for consuming entertainment, isn't it?
19/05/2020, 17:27 - Preetam Nath: That's like saying all entertainment is equal. Which is not true.
19/05/2020, 17:31 - +91 81056 00720: What is entertaining for every individual is subjective.. what is funny to me might not be funny to someone else. .TikTok is just another enterainment channel.. Like in television.. few channels are informative.. few are timepass.. few are waste of time.. similarly Tiktok is different for different people.. based on who you follow and what kind of videos you are enjoying..

19/05/2020, 17:38 - Aayush: One way to ask the question is if rape is entertaining, should it still be promoted for consumption - This is not exactly a PM question but goes into other things like law / being a republic while balancing a democracy / ethics
19/05/2020, 17:38 - +91 97426 08800: Did you use Vine? Would you say the same about it?

19/05/2020, 17:39 - Aayush: No the point is entertainment
19/05/2020, 17:39 - Aayush: Vs illegal vs immoral

19/05/2020, 17:40 - +91 72591 76020: my drunk friends are entertainment
19/05/2020, 17:40 - +91 72591 76020: Yes
19/05/2020, 17:40 - Aayush: Why should they? Why should they not?
19/05/2020, 17:40 - +91 99089 50101: FWIW, A and B worked in Zoom's favour after angry kids brought the ratings down to 2. Google restored the original ratings.
19/05/2020, 17:41 - Preetam Nath: Yes, not because you're a PM but as a human being.

No, because most PMs will "signal" virtue of being moral instead of actually living a life of high morality.
19/05/2020, 17:46 - Aayush: But PM gets paid, humans don‚Äôt
19/05/2020, 17:46 - Aayush: Don‚Äôt you think the payment warrants anything that is not strictly illegal?
19/05/2020, 17:50 - Aamna Khan: Don't mean to be a downer but is this discussion better fitted for a philosophy fork?

19/05/2020, 19:31 - +91 97437 82962: I was enjoying the discussion but I agree, it is for separate fork.
19/05/2020, 19:32 - Aayush: Yes, also this would help us reach target KPI of 3 additional forks every month, we under performed last month
19/05/2020, 19:40 - Amit Singh: Why?
19/05/2020, 19:41 - Abhishek Tiwari: #ask

20/05/2020, 05:53 - +44 7774 406149: In China, Douyin has exactly same UX for their shops and is integrated with Taobao. It was launched in 2018. FB owns more than that. It owns all the distribution channels outside China + Amazon + Google now.
20/05/2020, 06:13 - Aayush: And physical points and telecom and payments

20/05/2020, 09:05 - +91 70328 02600: So, does FB compete with Shopify now? Didn't shopify also launch a consumer app called Shop recently?
20/05/2020, 09:18 - +91 97437 82962: But Facebook has captive users, what Shopify doesn't have. So to me fb is much better placed to pull this off
20/05/2020, 09:56 - +91 72591 76020: they are using Shopify/woocommerce etc . 

Seems like a typical aggregator move
20/05/2020, 09:57 - Nachi: fb is using shopify
20/05/2020, 09:57 - Nachi: i was hearing it and it looks like FB is just following pinterest

20/05/2020, 10:03 - +91 97437 82962: Interesting move! That also means they don't want to go deeper into the game. Just want to enable better listings.
20/05/2020, 10:04 - +44 7774 406149: They have tried this as a pilot before. It failed.

20/05/2020, 12:29 - Nachi: even google tried this a couple times. We should call it the platform ego
20/05/2020, 12:30 - Nachi: or the distribution ego
20/05/2020, 12:30 - Nachi: we'll see how this pans out
20/05/2020, 12:40 - +44 7774 406149: +1
20/05/2020, 12:42 - +44 7774 406149: This one has better probability to succeed because here, they are capitalising on their strengths (distribution). Before this, they wanted SMEs to come build shops on Facebook (the one I said failed).
20/05/2020, 12:43 - +44 7774 406149: On that note, a quick dipstick: How may of you have ever bought anything via Instagram add?
20/05/2020, 12:45 - +91 98186 49039: Not bought immediately, but gave awareness to some niche stuff which I bought later
20/05/2020, 13:16 - +91 99375 36453: Shameless plug on an unusual webinar:p

We're launching an epic jam between a wandering musician and a poet on the tunes of Product Management. Our very own @919686811344 would be hosting John Cutler, Product Evangelist (Amplitude) shooting all the unusual questions around stakeholder management, research, measurement, etc. I'm excited:p.

You can book here.

20/05/2020, 13:28 - +91 97571 63031: Hi folks! Looking to connect with email marketing agencies to run some campaigns. Would anyone happen to know some companies I could talk to?
20/05/2020, 13:43 - +91 88617 98719: Did you guys hear that loud sound / vibrations ;!!
20/05/2020, 13:43 - +91 97413 36633: Yeah heard it in Marathahalli - wonder what this was
20/05/2020, 13:43 - +91 88617 98719: Scary
20/05/2020, 13:44 - +91 99809 65477: Yes, sounded like a bomb. Could hear it at Bellandur
20/05/2020, 13:44 - +91 99375 36453: Yes
20/05/2020, 13:44 - +91 99375 36453: Apparently everyone in Bangalore heard it:/
20/05/2020, 13:44 - +91 99809 65477: Could have been a sonic boom. Lot of air activity over HAL today
20/05/2020, 13:45 - +91 98186 49039: +1, I live in wind tunnel road near the Hal airport, possibly this
20/05/2020, 13:47 - Jasnoor Gill: Yeah, lca testing usually
20/05/2020, 13:48 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Triggered car alarms in my neighborhood, in Ulsoor.

20/05/2020, 13:52 - Praneeth Bakki Rapido: https://twitter.com/saffrontrail/status/1263017110281744384
20/05/2020, 13:53 - +91 99870 94433: sonic boom is continuous - not a single blast.
20/05/2020, 13:57 - +91 96633 75213: This video was in my backlog for a long time. Finally watched it, and the first 10 minutes itself was quite valuable to watch. If you haven't seen it yet, the full talk (45 minutes) has some useful stuff for us as managers - the why behind how we behave in orgs.

20/05/2020, 14:35 - +91 70328 02600: It's as if all startups were waiting for lockdown to be lifted to announce the firings :
1. Ola - 1400 ppl
2. Sharechat - 25% of workforce
3. Livspace - 15% of workforce

Sharechat is unique, as I expected their business to improve with everyone having higher leisure time
20/05/2020, 15:35 - Kumar Aakash: Pre requisite to improvement of biz is having a business
20/05/2020, 15:39 - +91 99020 11644: So true
20/05/2020, 15:49 - Nachi: expected since all their growth projections and hence growth experiments are being canned. so lesser man powere requied to pursue those
20/05/2020, 15:50 - Nachi: looking at AOPs of companies, growth expectations are cut almost across the board by 30%.
20/05/2020, 15:51 - Kumar Aakash: ** "having a business" reference was only sharechat and not others :)
20/05/2020, 15:52 - Kumar Aakash: livspace IMO is now doing the right thing that they should have been ..invest in building a platform instead of having 500-600 designers + sellers  on roll
20/05/2020, 15:55 - +91 96633 75213: What's AOP?
20/05/2020, 15:56 - Jasnoor Gill: Open job position
20/05/2020, 15:56 - Nachi: Annual operating Plan
20/05/2020, 15:57 - Jasnoor Gill: I have a different abbr looks like üòÇ
20/05/2020, 15:57 - Nachi: if you are a founder or vp and above at an organization, investors/board discuss how to spend money (areas to invest in)
20/05/2020, 15:57 - Nachi: based on that is how strategy, hiring plan, and roadmaps are decided
20/05/2020, 16:09 - Aayush: Ouch
20/05/2020, 16:23 - Mayank Berlin: üî•üî•Epic burn üî•üî•
20/05/2020, 16:26 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Sunny Leone has 3M followers on Sharechat and is selling her cosmetics brand there :) Not sure of sales numbers though.
20/05/2020, 16:30 - Kumar Aakash: 1/10th insta base ..even assuming no difference in paying capacity and quality of audience --> peanuts in terms of CPS monetisation
20/05/2020, 16:44 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Thanks! This helps put in perspective
20/05/2020, 16:48 - +91 72591 76020: Folks any connects at instamojo? A friend is looking to run donations campaigns for food for migrants and is looking to get fees waived
20/05/2020, 16:48 - Suhas Motwani PM: @919741336633 does Razorpay also have something similar?
20/05/2020, 16:49 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Connect. I'd connect with CTO
20/05/2020, 16:50 - +91 72591 76020: üôè will do

20/05/2020, 18:34 - Adam Walker: Hey. Anyone aware of whether Freshworks can be a ‚Äúsource‚Äù in Segment?
20/05/2020, 18:36 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: I know Freshsales has an integration but not sure of the nature of it and if it can serve as a source. Best is to ask over email to the support team with the use case and goal. They will respond and help you out
20/05/2020, 18:37 - Adam Walker: Thanks Srikrishnan! 
I will do this.

20/05/2020, 19:18 - +91 99809 65477: 'Alcohol' and 'beer' are negative keywords it seems :p
20/05/2020, 19:18 - +91 99809 65477: Also, tangy tomato is disgusting
20/05/2020, 19:18 - +91 99870 94433: +1

20/05/2020, 19:21 - +91 99870 94433: do they still do that jamaican west indian thing? that was great
20/05/2020, 19:21 - +91 91080 14100: What does fake beer taste like ?
20/05/2020, 19:21 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: The green bag is the only bag to buy. Yellow or Blue when you really need a change. Red never.
20/05/2020, 19:21 - +91 91080 14100: And why would anyone buy that ?
20/05/2020, 19:22 - +91 99809 65477: Fake beer
20/05/2020, 19:23 - Aayush: Time for beer fork, no?
20/05/2020, 19:23 - +91 99870 94433: every group is essentially a beer fork, given enough time.
20/05/2020, 19:23 - Aayush: (PS: No, it‚Äôs not)
20/05/2020, 19:24 - +91 97413 36633: Yeah absolutely
20/05/2020, 19:41 - +91 72591 76020: CNN news 18 is doing a positive story on tiktock
20/05/2020, 19:43 - +91 72591 76020: Someone is flexing network to beat the negative ratings

21/05/2020, 10:01 - +91 91080 14100: #nicetry. Has anyone come across a script that could do what a vacation responder does but for whatsapp - automatically send out a canned message to all incoming pings
21/05/2020, 10:01 - +91 91080 14100: ?
21/05/2020, 10:02 - +91 91080 14100: Heading out on my paternity and gross realisation that work has moved to whatsapp than email in the last 45 days or so
21/05/2020, 10:02 - +91 91080 14100: :(
21/05/2020, 10:07 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tkstudio.autoresponderforwa&hl=en_IN
21/05/2020, 10:08 - +91 91080 14100: Ooo , thanks . Never thought it would be an app.
21/05/2020, 10:08 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: One hack could be to turn it into a business account and use WhatsApp for business, in which you can have auto responders I believe. Not sure you can get it back as a regular number after that though!
21/05/2020, 10:13 - Preetam Nath: You can, at least when I tried about a year ago. I switched from regular to buisness and back
21/05/2020, 10:18 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: And keep the old regular messages when you go back?
21/05/2020, 10:19 - Preetam Nath: I don't recall exactly. But yes when I switched back, messages in the regular app were there. Although I think the new messages received while I was using the business app did not carry over.
21/05/2020, 10:24 - Preetam Nath: Really cool! Did not know such an app existed
21/05/2020, 10:25 - +91 91080 14100: The challenge now is to draft a message that doesn't offend the long lost friend or the uncle with daily forwards
21/05/2020, 10:25 - +91 91080 14100: Ideas welcome
21/05/2020, 10:30 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: Looks like this app reads the notifications and works on top of that. Perhaps you could have rules that do the auto response only to messages from certain numbers (business contacts).
21/05/2020, 11:11 - +91 89762 08450: Thanks everyone for your wishes. Really appreciate it üòä
21/05/2020, 11:31 - +91 87930 00818: Hey Guys, I am planning to use notion for my personal use to track to do list, meeting notes and other stuff. Currently I have been using Evernote for the same. Any links or blog which I can look around to learn how I can use Notion best for these purposes.

https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/21/amazon-launches-food-delivery-service-in-india/
21/05/2020, 15:49 - Anuj Gupta: These technologies will probably increase the value of things like logic programming (where you specify "what" you want the computer to do and it figures out the "how") as well as formal verification (which is used, esp. for critical systems, to formalize and verify that the program works based on a specification).
21/05/2020, 15:50 - Anuj Gupta: For simpler and less critical objectives, when machine learning starts generating code based on opaque prediction models, the value of being able to understand logic and identify bugs goes up relative to editing copy/pasted code. We will require fewer coders, but they will be significantly more skilled and productive. Their role will evolve in various ways, such as "outlining systems" instead of "describing steps".

21/05/2020, 17:58 - Nachi: @919560985630  said something similar with nice analysis a while back
21/05/2020, 17:59 - Nachi: just wondering if indian b2c was working on the assumption or trend of users spending more in the future. i.e gdp per capita increasing as it was the case with china
21/05/2020, 18:04 - +91 81233 27117: I always assumed it was taken for granted. Acquire as many users as possible -> Build features/product lines to increase top of the mind recall (habituate) ->  Segment, Cross Sell to Increase ARPU or die trying.
21/05/2020, 18:12 - Aayush: I think we discovered quite a while back that this wasn‚Äôt going to be the case
21/05/2020, 18:13 - +91 99375 36453: For Zomato, Hyperpure could have been the game changer. Acquire users ---> Keep the discount game open ---> Earn from the supply via hyperpure

21/05/2020, 18:50 - Ujjwal Trivedi: But are they subsidizing? Last I checked (pre-covid) I was paying ~ Rs 200+ for a Rs 150 order.

22/05/2020, 00:02 - +91 72591 76020: Shopify is WFH till 2021
22/05/2020, 00:02 - +91 99305 30939: and then permanent remote after that.
22/05/2020, 00:04 - +91 99305 30939: So in some sense, a big protectionist wave is coming. We already saw in UK with Brexit. In COVID and post COVID world, there would be a huge focus on hiring locally and denying outsiders Visas. So going remote and hiring remote might help these tech companies to manage that shift.

Hello all
Currently heading product at Mosaic Wellness which is gearing towards becoming a family of varied D2C brands.
Come from beginnings and background in design and dabble around a little with code. 
Look forward to interesting conversations and learnings here.
22/05/2020, 01:00 - Aayush: Welcome Tushar / D2C in medicinal / health / wellness right?
22/05/2020, 01:00 - +91 95552 25384: Yes
22/05/2020, 01:01 - Aayush: You guys are doing a beautiful thing, hope it succeeds.
22/05/2020, 01:02 - Suhas Motwani PM: Welcome Tushar! Thoughts on something like hundred (https://www.joinhundred.com) for India? 

..or is there something already?
22/05/2020, 01:03 - +91 99375 36453: I thought these guys were doing it already
22/05/2020, 01:03 - +91 99375 36453: https://supp.in/
22/05/2020, 01:03 - +91 95552 25384: There are a couple. Supp for eg. although the model varies a little for each and the touchpoints with experts and doctors is something that a lot of people are trying to solve
22/05/2020, 01:03 - Suhas Motwani PM: Yes, very similar! Know someone there?
22/05/2020, 01:03 - +91 95609 85630: DMing you :)
22/05/2020, 01:04 - Suhas Motwani PM: Thanks!
22/05/2020, 01:08 - +91 95552 25384: Our first brand (still early launch) is called Man Matters.

https://manmatters.com/

Focussed more on prescription and doctor based approach towards specific problems.

As well as building out different form factors for nutra 

try.manmatters.com/acv-gummies

Quite an interesting space and behaviours. If nothing else, the customer conversations are pure delight.
22/05/2020, 01:08 - +91 99375 36453: Perfect
22/05/2020, 01:09 - +91 99375 36453: Not really:/

22/05/2020, 01:09 - +91 99375 36453: I believe thay will enter this market soon. I remember then being a part of YC last year.
22/05/2020, 01:09 - Aayush: Huge space
22/05/2020, 01:11 - +91 95552 25384: They are already. Been around 7-8 months now. From what our manufacturers tell us, doing fairly decent amount of sales as well
22/05/2020, 01:11 - +91 99375 36453: Nice
22/05/2020, 01:11 - Aayush: So both of you have same manufacturers as of now?
22/05/2020, 01:11 - +91 99375 36453: Hyderabad based
22/05/2020, 01:12 - +91 95552 25384: Not same. Parts of the supply chain overlap - printers/pharmacists/packaging etc
22/05/2020, 01:13 - Aayush: Okay
22/05/2020, 01:13 - +91 99375 36453: I guess have seen Man matters products listed on Cred too:) @919555225384
22/05/2020, 01:21 - +91 95552 25384: Yes. We‚Äôve been on Cred for almost two months now. Both partnerships - Cred Store (purchase on CRED) and coupon code based

22/05/2020, 12:42 - Preetam Nath: SaaS for SaaS. Lovely!
22/05/2020, 16:48 - +91 6361 304 501: Am migrating from Hubspot to Close.io. Sick of the slow and sales unfriendly UX of Hubspot for email / phone outreach. And their per user pricing for marketing automation. My only issue is with finding something that can send quotes. Chargebee doesn‚Äôt enable quotes with payment integration on the free tier. Does anyone have any other good solutions for this?
22/05/2020, 16:52 - +91 6361 304 501: Quite bizarre of chargebee to do this. Pretty much the first thing any startup would want to do with a payment system be able to send a quote and get an advance!
22/05/2020, 17:01 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: not sure if you have tried revvsales
22/05/2020, 17:07 - +91 6361 304 501: I‚Äôm not able to figure out if they have a stripe integration from their site
22/05/2020, 17:39 - +91 95552 25384: Id suggest a better way could be to connect chargebee to stripe to generate a payment link and fhen use the connection to put the link in the qoute communication (email/invoice pdf). Which should be neatly possible through Zapier or Automate. Not sure if this helps you out completely @916361304501 
But this will work in most cases with a little tinkering with webhooks.
22/05/2020, 17:58 - +91 6361 304 501: So that‚Äôs chargebee + a quote software + stripe?
22/05/2020, 18:04 - +91 95552 25384: Yes. So the zapier setup could be. Chargebee/any other platform (trigger)-> zapier (to tell stripe to create a payment link) -> Stripe (create payment link) ->Communication/quote platform(can be same as first step (append payment link to a mail/invoice)
22/05/2020, 18:05 - +91 95552 25384: OR -> chargebee (trigger) -> catch hook (zpaier url) -> google sheets (to log all events) -> quote service that has a stripe integration)
22/05/2020, 18:05 - +91 95552 25384: Or any other layer in between to communicate freely
22/05/2020, 18:15 - +91 6361 304 501: Okay thank you!
22/05/2020, 20:56 - +91 6361 304 501: Is there any reason why you wouldn‚Äôt just use stripe billing @919555225384?
22/05/2020, 20:57 - +91 6361 304 501: We are only processing around 3-5 transactions a month at the moment
22/05/2020, 21:07 - +91 95552 25384: Got it. Then the above doesnt make a lot of sense for you.
22/05/2020, 21:12 - +91 6361 304 501: Yes but good to know. I appreciate the guidance. Thanks. Am sure I‚Äôll need this in the future.

1) Do you know this guy ?¬†Ans : Yes, it's me. I maybe know him 99%.¬†
2) What about the baby ? Why work now ?¬†Ans : Baby is 8m old, I finally got to take time off now to help babysit more¬†
3) You said Supply side PM - can you come work on Supply side problems ?¬†Ans. Nope, this is just me trying to learn something new.¬†
4) Have you been laid off ?¬†Ans. Nope, thankfully my firm is setting new all time high records every single day due to increased online ordering
5) Will you really work for books ?¬†Ans. Well the list is long, and I have a thing for Hardcovers :)¬†
6) What do you want to do ?¬†Ans. Think about what a fresh out of college intern would do on the demand/ growth side. Maybe that.

23/05/2020, 15:32 - Ankit Pansari: Is there a SaaS app for managing organisation structures? Like who is reporting to whom? Something which can link with Gsuite?
23/05/2020, 15:32 - Nachi: yeah, depends on the size of company
23/05/2020, 15:34 - Nachi: or SMB midmarket, i have seen companies use Pingboard
23/05/2020, 15:34 - Nachi: elite firms use names and faces
23/05/2020, 15:37 - Nachi: not sure about linking to gsuite
23/05/2020, 15:38 - Nachi: @917008230661  just checked. pingboard integrates with gsuite
23/05/2020, 15:54 - Kumar Aakash: Analytically sound .. takes a few leaps in concluding just on back of personal opinion .. slightly overwhelming with data .. longer than it needs to be ..overall decently written :).. subscribed üòÅ

23/05/2020, 16:20 - Ankit Pansari: Pingboard works. This is something I was looking for
23/05/2020, 16:20 - Ankit Pansari: Org structure available as an API. But which links with AD and Gsuite.

23/05/2020, 16:21 - Ankit Pansari: There is no app with two way Gsuite integration.
23/05/2020, 16:22 - Nachi: two way?
23/05/2020, 16:22 - Nachi: i saw pingboard had some amount of integration
23/05/2020, 17:31 - Pankaj Chauhan: Definitely detailed, but it's filled with assumptions that paint a picture much prettier than what it is, most importantly, the reseller behaviour is far from assumptions here, social commerce has its benifits but it has long list of challenges, and some of them put a big question mark on its scalibility
23/05/2020, 18:21 - +91 70328 02600: It think, would have helped to include disclaimer more prominently. Good Capital is an investor in Meesho, right?
23/05/2020, 19:24 - Aayush: This message was deleted
23/05/2020, 19:25 - Aayush: Who all here have hired for roles within the Covid-19 time period and if yes, how are you handholding them, training them, teaching them etc?
23/05/2020, 19:26 - Jasnoor Gill: On-boarded a sr PM. Mostly documents/videos, have another PM sync with him daily to answer basic queries, onboard on tools etc.
For a while I was talking to him 1hr daily to explain competitive/overall strategy etc. Then switched to alternate days after 3 weeks or so
23/05/2020, 19:27 - Jasnoor Gill: Plan is to taper off to on demand as he starts being productive and so on
23/05/2020, 19:28 - Aayush: What was his experience level?

Because how would this work for 
0-1 year work-ex
1-3 year work ex
3-5 year work ex
23/05/2020, 19:28 - Jasnoor Gill: But then I also gave him tons of industry specific/public product docs to read up on while he was in his notice period etc,
23/05/2020, 19:28 - Aayush: Ok
23/05/2020, 19:29 - Jasnoor Gill: Very high. ~ 19yrsü§£
23/05/2020, 19:29 - Aayush: Haan so he will get it
23/05/2020, 19:29 - Aayush: S/he
23/05/2020, 19:30 - Aayush: Much easier with experienced candidates - but how does it work for inexperienced folks?
23/05/2020, 19:30 - Jasnoor Gill: Yup yup. For junior folks, more handholding needed I imagine, but it also separates the self starter ones from those who must be told each and every thing to do etc
23/05/2020, 19:31 - Aayush: So if this is true, inexperienced folks will be hired less because of this fear. Is this assumption wrong? Many managers, at their own level, will think in this way.
23/05/2020, 19:33 - Jasnoor Gill: I don't think it's only a function of exp.
23/05/2020, 19:34 - Aayush: Fair but possibly one of the most important filters at the moment?
23/05/2020, 19:36 - Jasnoor Gill: Anyone hiring on the exp filter is paying accordingly, and I doubt you'll how a more exp/sr guy just because he might ramp quicker
23/05/2020, 19:36 - Jasnoor Gill: *hire a
23/05/2020, 19:36 - Aayush: When in remote, you mean
23/05/2020, 19:41 - Jasnoor Gill: Any time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
23/05/2020, 19:58 - +91 98929 43123: Yes. We are fully distributed. Don't hire freshers. For exactly this reason.
23/05/2020, 20:00 - +91 98929 43123: Yeah we don't dilter for years of experience, it is a level of "do you understand what it means to be a team member and a working professional". Typically freshers get weaned out because of simple things like not showing up on time, taking a video call too casually etc.
23/05/2020, 20:00 - +91 98929 43123: Won't come good on a time commitment made
23/05/2020, 20:05 - +91 98929 43123: But yeah, early on did hire a couple of relatively fresher. Handholding was too much for a distributed team , was easy to disappear.
23/05/2020, 20:50 - Aayush: Yes this is a worry
23/05/2020, 20:51 - +1 (646) 599-4768: Thanks Ishan!
23/05/2020, 20:51 - +1 (646) 599-4768: Good to see you here :)
23/05/2020, 21:12 - +91 93807 40700: Hired two content people ~1.5 months ago. One has 2-3 years exp and the other about 10 in terms of expertise, but in terns of familiarity with the industry --> 0.

I found that setting some ground rules helps, regardless of experience, like "respond to meeting invites", "return calls if missed", drafting emails in the right tone, what can be figured out over chat and what should be discussed over a call, etc. And weekly 1-1s. Both are driven (not a function of experience) - something to gauge in the interview process. They are getting work done, showing up for meetings and already taking ownership wherever they can. That's really all that matters.

If they're unsure, they ping/call and ask. As long as that line of communication is open, it should be okay, even for driven freshers. It might mean a little extra effort from the manager, but skills can be taught if the will exists.

25/05/2020, 12:46 - Sankshep Swiggy: Imo the ux is confusing,  the whole idea of search is a high intent discovery.    The discovery framework outside search shud handle these nudges.
25/05/2020, 12:46 - Sankshep Swiggy: Small nudges are fine, but this is kinda full blown distraction
25/05/2020, 12:49 - Nachi: i disagree. UX is relative. so far high intent discovery was centered around 1 type of product. This was an artifact from the times when ecommerces was exclusively lifestyle, books. and electronics. With the advent of grocery shopping,  a common behavior is to create a shopping list in analog. I think its great someone is trying to bring that convenience to digital world

25/05/2020, 12:52 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: I just tried it out and it seems super useful!
25/05/2020, 12:52 - Pankaj Chauhan: I doubt it will be useful or help with conversion, in in past we found rarely anyone was in "hurry" to make the order, rather they would use cart as shopping list, and put in products when they remember something, and when they feel they are done they put in the order
25/05/2020, 12:53 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: Only thing to tweak - perhaps removing items already added to cart from a search from their suggested search list
25/05/2020, 12:54 - Preetam Nath: Indeed. If I'm going online to shop groceries, I already have a list of 8-10 items in mind. Upon becoming a repeat customer, a BB Smartbasket like feature should do the job.

But when looking for a few new products, this search an entire list in one go feature seems extremely handy.
25/05/2020, 12:56 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: Depends on kind of user. My mom still keeps a list on paper and then goes to the app one day or asks me to order her list for her. Searching one by one entering into the box is painful. This is much nicer for this use case, except it continues to show all items and doesn‚Äôt remove from the list once you add one
25/05/2020, 13:02 - Pankaj Chauhan: Mostly have a list in mind, some on paper, so giving them the cart from which to pick helps, also recommendations with every add to cart to discover a new item to add, these help, and although there might be user liking this, when we did this, "saving time" was a need noone had, while not missing out on something they should have added while placing order was a need and it did result in higher conversion and higher AOV, but any feature directed to "save time" was waste, infact complicating search never worked in favour, highest ATC comes not from the scrolled list but from the top result shown, so quality of result had always beaten quantity, that's been my experience
25/05/2020, 13:02 - Rakesh MyGate PM: This is interesting. What kind of usage does a BB Smartbasket find of feature have if this is the case? Think its been around for a while now, wondering if people really find it useful (dont shop on BB, so don't use this personally).
25/05/2020, 13:10 - Pankaj Chauhan: I think the basic gap is in what consumer prefers to do, yes, a shopping list works, but for average consumer it's much easier to just go through their lives and add to cart what might be running out, rather then inspecting the whole kitchen and planning the month ahead in one sitting
25/05/2020, 13:11 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: For clarity, this isn't a nudge in the sense, it isn't "people who searched this also searched for X". it is your own other searches from the list that all show up there. you can type in and then go click, click, click.
25/05/2020, 13:11 - Nachi: lot has changed recently. habits are changing, so its prudent to experiment. also this is the kinda thinking thats anti to a core tenets of being a product manager.  This is not putting the user in the center of the experience or testing things
25/05/2020, 13:12 - Pankaj Chauhan: That's why contextual recommendations help, they bind seamlessly with the process they want to do, i.e. having making the cart as side process in their life
25/05/2020, 13:12 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: to me - even things you add to your list, you remember in bunches - so if you think let me add "these 3 items to cart", the feature makes sense there too.
25/05/2020, 13:15 - +91 99020 11644: Some shopping list have interdependencies. For instance, if they don‚Äôt have butter - I won‚Äôt order bread. That process of iteration is painful one at a time. 

I still find the above solution misses the mark in making that work well.
25/05/2020, 13:16 - +91 96633 75213: If this feature doesn't exist in a couple of months, it might mean this experiment didn't work. If it did, there will be a bunch of medium articles talking about this twist. New experiments that Reliance is trying and we'll be learning from.üôÇ
25/05/2020, 13:23 - Preetam Nath added +91 99008 07075
25/05/2020, 13:18 - Pankaj Chauhan: I'm not saying that anything is wrong with adding that feature, it's cool, but imo, it's just the extra glitter with a messy search results output, which I have never experienced working out favourably, rather, crisp and precise result + recommendation for next item worked wonders
25/05/2020, 13:23 - Preetam Nath: Added Apurva who leads conversation.ai, a fully independent extension of Haptik working on new product initiatives in conversational AI

25/05/2020, 13:27 - Nachi: that would be cool too. its like chaos engineering but for real world

25/05/2020, 13:30 - Ujjwal Trivedi: lol
25/05/2020, 13:30 - +91 97046 73794: üòÇ
25/05/2020, 13:31 - +91 97426 08800: Love the intent. Definitely starts out the mental model users have - that notepad list taped to the fridge. 
But the experience seems broken.  After getting the list, I would've created tabs for each item (like you have independent tabs for onwards and return ticket on travel airline ticket sites) 

But I don't know if this works better than BBs search where you can add items straigth from the search sugestions. Once you learn that pattern, its faster for a lot of things.
25/05/2020, 13:31 - Preetam Nath: Agreed, had same thought about tabs being a friendlier experience with the option to "X" dismiss a tab if I'm done adding products from that search term
25/05/2020, 13:32 - +91 97426 08800: OK just realised that the item names are clickable which makes it tab-ish. Partial retreat on "experience is broken" :P
25/05/2020, 13:33 - +91 99008 07075: Thank you Preetam!

25/05/2020, 14:39 - +91 96633 75213: In another circle, someone popped a question of 'why co-founder at this stage'. Other than founder stock vs. ESOPs, any other reason why someone might be given that title?
25/05/2020, 14:41 - Mayank Berlin: Messiah mania? Or Just rewards? What's the connotation?
25/05/2020, 14:42 - Jasnoor Gill: Retention, gives formal recognition, perhaps? To keep him around?
25/05/2020, 14:43 - Jasnoor Gill: Could be founder voting rights/stock, but I doubt you need to give title for that
25/05/2020, 14:43 - Jasnoor Gill: Likewise, I doubt deepinders giving up board control or half ownershipü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

25/05/2020, 14:50 - Aayush: If you make credible people part of your incredible journey, your incredible journey looks more credible, at least for the short run, till you find other answers.

Zomato by far would have the highest leadership rotation for any unicorn in India by a large number. What is that representative of? That‚Äôs an introspective question.

However these moves have and will become more common as we go along, happening in similar forms faster, but also popping up in some dissimilar firms.
25/05/2020, 14:52 - Aayush: If you look at the current hiring trends, it‚Äôs beginning to shape up - the choices are all towards corporatisation however minus the economics and perhaps the backbone human resource strength of a corporate.
25/05/2020, 14:53 - Aayush: Something akin to a Chimera.
25/05/2020, 14:59 - Jasnoor Gill: The rotation? From what I hear quite a bit of micro management and lack of willingness to give up control :)
25/05/2020, 15:17 - Ujjwal Trivedi: https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1264663145634648064 Notice those >30% lurkers.

25/05/2020, 16:32 - Aayush: Yes, also carrot vs stick
25/05/2020, 16:43 - Aayush: Very nice discussion on this - May be we should ask a simpler question - What‚Äôs the cost of this feature vs possibly benefits vs time to turn around?
25/05/2020, 16:45 - Nachi: let me take a guess: 
Effort/cost: M
Reach: L/XL
Confidence: M
Impact: TBD
25/05/2020, 16:47 - Aayush: Shouldn‚Äôt this be the first question we need to ask while evaluating a change in UX?
25/05/2020, 16:52 - Ujjwal Trivedi: sounds about right.
25/05/2020, 16:53 - Nazz: While we are at this, what is your favorite feature prioritization framework? And why?
25/05/2020, 16:56 - Ujjwal Trivedi: One of those "add on" delight features that are good for engaging users for a limited time. Can lead to some personalisation insights and more flavors of this feature in future.
25/05/2020, 16:57 - Nachi: nope, i start with user desirability
25/05/2020, 16:57 - Aayush: That‚Äôs a check on demand side
25/05/2020, 16:57 - Aayush: Which is a base check
25/05/2020, 16:58 - Aayush: Works well with engagement based apps
25/05/2020, 16:58 - Aayush: Not necessarily true for some other sectors
25/05/2020, 16:58 - Aayush: In fact even in engagement based apps it may depend on size of app (DAU / MAU)
25/05/2020, 16:59 - Ujjwal Trivedi: rice, while considering stage and feature brackets.
25/05/2020, 17:08 - Nazz: Why?

25/05/2020, 17:18 - +91 95552 25384: Goals -> Signals -> Metrics. Goals at a higher level on monthly OKR chase. Broken down on a feature as (Functional, Persuasive, Delightful) -> multiple signals against each goal to define success/failure/reiterate -> multiple metrics to a signal to measure and chart. Why = Flows across multiple functions seamlessly. Iterates every sprint. Weeds out irrelevant stuff
25/05/2020, 17:19 - +91 95552 25384: Lets syncup sometime
25/05/2020, 17:30 - Nazz: Wondering how Reach is relevant in B2B or some B2C SaaS scenarios where 80% biz comes from 20%. Also, isn't confidence taken care of by T-shirt sizing or Fibonacci
25/05/2020, 17:30 - Nazz: ?
25/05/2020, 17:46 - +91 96633 75213: T-shirt sizing is more for effort. Confidence is a rough guess based on experience or third party information about potential success.
25/05/2020, 17:47 - +91 96633 75213: Third party info like any approx data shared in articles or if competitors now have this feature and appears to be successful

25/05/2020, 18:13 - Nazz: Yes, Artifacia :)
25/05/2020, 18:15 - +91 99005 74294: You can talk to Clarifai for this. They are pretty good and much simpler than Google or Microsoft in terms of integration effort.
25/05/2020, 18:17 - +91 99005 74294: 2014-2016 was the API period for us. We used the same tech to build our SaaS product after that which gave us some traction üòâ
25/05/2020, 18:19 - +91 72591 76020: so I have become very contrarian when it comes to SEO, my view is most people push side effects as the thing to improve SEO, whereas the content is what is important, and consistency. I will publish a blog and share it. But to give you a back story, explaining SEO at YourStory was hard, I had to do it in simpler ways. 

Also when I noticed 1 page ranking for 2K plus key phrases, some which did not exist in the content .. I realized "keywords" don't matter, the content does.
25/05/2020, 18:20 - Kumar Aakash: üëèüëè
25/05/2020, 18:20 - +91 6361 304 501: Presumably keywords matter until backlinks matter?
25/05/2020, 18:20 - Aayush: Yes but you can‚Äôt make money by saying such things
25/05/2020, 18:21 - +91 72591 76020: which is why I am a shitty consultant :)
25/05/2020, 18:21 - Aayush: Make it sound like black magic and then laugh at people
25/05/2020, 18:21 - Aayush: Send them a quote over PM
25/05/2020, 18:24 - Suhas Motwani PM: @919008767748 can point you to someone
25/05/2020, 18:24 - +91 72591 76020: I tell people the truth for free ... and they never get back to me
25/05/2020, 18:25 - Aayush: That‚Äôs why ask people what will make them pay first
25/05/2020, 18:28 - Ujjwal Trivedi: <Media omitted>
25/05/2020, 18:45 - Ankit Pansari: Any founders with Delaware Incorporation in the groups?
25/05/2020, 18:48 - +91 6361 304 501: Yup
25/05/2020, 18:48 - +91 6361 304 501: This stupid BEA form?
25/05/2020, 18:48 - Ankit Pansari: Lol. Yeah
25/05/2020, 18:49 - Ankit Pansari: DM'ing.
25/05/2020, 19:08 - Nazz: Hallelujah! I had found Clarifai the most useful. Validates it.
25/05/2020, 19:09 - Nachi: +üíØ
25/05/2020, 19:09 - Nachi: for the use case you mentioned, its one of the best. Avoid MSFT at all cost. takes 2x the effort for 1/2 the valie
25/05/2020, 19:14 - Nachi: respectfully disagree
25/05/2020, 19:15 - +91 89762 08450 left

25/05/2020, 19:16 - +91 99008 07075: I made a store on shopify recently. Not sure what exact gyan you might want but can try helping!
25/05/2020, 19:17 - +91 99008 07075: hahah
anyone who was building app around 2015, @917259176020 would have definitely sold analytics to them!
25/05/2020, 19:42 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Desirability is a definite starting point. Sometimes though, even if user doesn't desire that change, one still might have to do it for business reasons.
25/05/2020, 19:47 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Why is Reach not relevant for B2B? Impact is a f(x) of how much and how many. I need to know how many clients/users will need this/use this.
25/05/2020, 21:13 - Aamna Khan: Anyone have an idea about ideal engagement & user activity rate for Insta influencers?
25/05/2020, 21:14 - +91 70328 02600: What do you mean by "content"? The topic of the post, how well is it written/engages the audience?
25/05/2020, 21:18 - +91 99008 07075: 10% of followers is a good benchmark.
25/05/2020, 22:06 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Unless and until the content has all relevant info/questions or Keywords - there is no way that you can rank articles I believe
25/05/2020, 22:06 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Case is different for "utility tools" such as speed test, loan calculator etc
25/05/2020, 22:07 - Suumit Shah Rankz: So even if you write something which is super duper useful for users - it doesn't really matters :)
25/05/2020, 22:07 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Plus YS isn't a great example of SEO
25/05/2020, 22:07 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Most of the traffic comes for random written stories by users lol
25/05/2020, 22:07 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Whole UGC play!
25/05/2020, 22:37 - +91 72591 76020: As I said, I am a contrarian now :). Most media companies are content farms, which is pretty unfortunate, but once in a while there is content that does very well. I just made sure everything else was top notch during my time there.
25/05/2020, 22:43 - +91 72591 76020: The topics your audiences read/want which are in your domain.
25/05/2020, 22:49 - +91 72591 76020: Drift & Intercom are great examples. Zapier uses a different approach but achieves the same end goal
25/05/2020, 23:00 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Gotcha :)
25/05/2020, 23:27 - +91 97696 97565: Great examples - can you please double click on this?
25/05/2020, 23:37 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Drift - Total "search" traffic around 800k but the traffic on blog is ~ 9k
Intercom - Total "search" traffic around 200k and traffic on blog/ is around ~14k

Wondering what makes you think that they have done exceptional job with SEO? Although their brand traffic and other avenues are contributing much more traffic. But clearly - not a good example of content marketing/SEO at all!
25/05/2020, 23:38 - Suhas Motwani PM: Wtb Zapier? Numbers?
25/05/2020, 23:39 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Ahrefs could be the best example of CONTENT MARKETING or SEO - their blog generated over half million organic traffic per month and probably the biggest user acquisition channel for them
25/05/2020, 23:39 - Suhas Motwani PM: Also any Indian examples?
25/05/2020, 23:39 - +91 97696 97565: Zapier has a landing page strategy and easy for them because of the kind of product
25/05/2020, 23:40 - Suumit Shah Rankz: Roughly 4M search traffic and blog gets over 700k
25/05/2020, 23:40 - +91 97696 97565: My presumption is it will be great for Zapier via use case driven landing pages
25/05/2020, 23:40 - Nachi: Postman - their academy and content was major driver of growth
25/05/2020, 23:41 - Suumit Shah Rankz: The best thing that they have done is created the list of "best XYZ apps" and integrated the use case of zapier
25/05/2020, 23:41 - Suumit Shah Rankz: and they've done it through BLOG - and pretty insane output in terms of Search Traffic
25/05/2020, 23:43 - Suumit Shah Rankz: https://www.postman.com/
https://www.postman.com/downloads/

these two pages contributes over 91% of the search traffic! And I believe it's the BRAND traffic
25/05/2020, 23:43 - Suumit Shah Rankz: That's exactly what they are doing and killing it
26/05/2020, 00:17 - +91 99809 65477: Please Google "Elon Musk resume". This is one of my favourite examples of a growth hack.
26/05/2020, 00:21 - +91 99809 65477: For those that don't want to, novoresume.com, a simple resume builder, floated a pretty cool one page resume of E.M. That one piece of content still drives their acquisition till date. What I love is that most of us in this group could have built this tool and employed this growth hack, if we thought of it first.

26/05/2020, 00:45 - +91 98180 62989: Thanks Maanav. 
Hey Guys
Glad to be here. I head sales and revenue partnerships for Helo, part of ByteDance. Prior to this, I was leading revenue partnerships at LinkedIn. Look forward to engaging with everyone!
26/05/2020, 09:38 - +91 72591 76020: This is brilliant :)
26/05/2020, 09:40 - +91 72591 76020: Content is much more than blog posts, so my choice of words might be confusing. They do podcasts, books, and a lot of posts on personal social channels too.
26/05/2020, 10:18 - Nazz: Because Reach is a number of users and in B2B, the Pareto principle mostly holds true. Your biggest customers drive most of your growth, even if they are just a couple of them. It would be better to replace reach in this case with Revenue potential/business value
26/05/2020, 10:45 - +91 99809 65477: Bigger pie means bigger 20% of pie, no?
26/05/2020, 10:46 - +91 99809 65477: Unless you've exhausted your niche
26/05/2020, 10:48 - Ujjwal Trivedi: revenue potential is anyways considered impact in rIce. Reach is how many will get impacted, Impact is how much impact will they have. Both need to be considered.
26/05/2020, 10:48 - +91 96633 75213: Even though it's B2B, this needn't be count of customers, it should be count of users within these customers who would be impacted by such a feature. So even if there are large B2B customers, I would assume this means a large number of users within.

If instead you mean a high value feature that is used by a CxO types and therefore has value on revenue, that would get covered under the impact field

Can we please add Amit, CEO of mobile gaming studio Nukebox. Their first game, Food Truck Chef, was voted the Best Game of 2017. They recently released another hit Spongebob: Krusty in partnership with Nickelodeon, which made 5 million downloads and 17 million registrations in a week of launch. 

Product Management in gaming companies is very analytical and fast-paced. I have learned a great deal from Amit. I thought it would be good to add some diversity to the group.

26/05/2020, 13:49 - Aamna Khan: Any examples of content that was taken down? What if description mentions we're taking all the necessary safety measures for COVID or something like that
26/05/2020, 13:54 - +91 98186 49039: +1, also what about in app donations for Covid-19 relief?
26/05/2020, 13:58 - Jai Quickride: The article mentions that in-app donations should not be a part of the apps they will approve at this time

26/05/2020, 14:00 - Jai Quickride: +1 for description

26/05/2020, 15:22 - Ujjwal Trivedi: idk, I don't have specific details. Maybe if someone who has connects with Google can find out more.

26/05/2020, 18:42 - Suhas Motwani PM: His paid content is worth it as well!
26/05/2020, 18:53 - Ankit Pansari: I don't like this entire Substack movement. Great content, no doubt. But I can easily see myself paying 10usd a month for close to 12 writers I like, along with the national daily I prefer to read.

Someone has to launch an aggregation service.
26/05/2020, 18:53 - +91 72591 76020: Question: Would you pay 5$ to Medium?
26/05/2020, 18:54 - Nachi: its not a natural Prduct-monetization fit. so they are doing the best to fit it.
26/05/2020, 18:54 - Nachi: its more about indviduals contribution and aggregation service will come with its own set of issues
26/05/2020, 18:55 - +91 72591 76020: Also, what are your views on the podcast movement?
26/05/2020, 18:56 - +91 72591 76020: I would say both are related
26/05/2020, 18:56 - Aayush: Every one can do 10-20-30-50-100 such items. Then what?
26/05/2020, 18:56 - Ankit Pansari: To be honest, I don't see the value. I have been a regular reader of Stratechery.com for three years. But if every writer starts going under paywall, the cost can easily spike up and one cannot have one to relationship with all the readers.
26/05/2020, 18:56 - +91 72591 76020: similar rather
26/05/2020, 18:57 - Aayush: Same reason why only people like Stratechery are worthy paying for - Because meta explanation.

News is momentary.
26/05/2020, 18:57 - +91 72591 76020: So a "No" to aggregation?
26/05/2020, 18:57 - Aayush: The argument is same for The Economist
26/05/2020, 18:57 - +91 72591 76020: "Because meta explanation" 100% , paid 3 years, now have stopped
26/05/2020, 18:58 - Ankit Pansari: Podcast is good. I can obviously listen more than I can read. But again paywall is a problem.
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: I think Stratechery is still perhaps in the 0.1% pay worthy content (or was till it started another such service)
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Ankit Pansari: Or Ken, Axios, New Yorker, Atlantic
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: Not really
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: Nothing comes close to the economist
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: New Yorker to some extent
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Ankit Pansari: That's subjective.
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: FT perhaps
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Ankit Pansari: Depends on your inclination
26/05/2020, 18:59 - Aayush: Ken is no where close
26/05/2020, 19:00 - Ankit Pansari: Ha ha... I give you that.
26/05/2020, 19:00 - Aayush: Morning context same problem
26/05/2020, 19:00 - +91 72591 76020: which is why aggregation won't work.
26/05/2020, 19:00 - Aayush: It won‚Äôt work but it is the only thing that will pay
26/05/2020, 19:00 - Ankit Pansari: Maybe I wanna pay per article. ITunes module.
26/05/2020, 19:01 - Aayush: Then fail
26/05/2020, 19:01 - Aayush: But it will happen
26/05/2020, 19:01 - +91 72591 76020: it breaks the revenue model for writers
26/05/2020, 19:01 - Aayush: People have taken the decoy pricing to think people are stupid
26/05/2020, 19:01 - +91 72591 76020: Explain please
26/05/2020, 19:02 - Aayush: Some of these economists would be ashamed to see how decoy pricing was being used today where the base matter is no where close to the value provided
26/05/2020, 19:04 - Ujjwal Trivedi: $4 for this article, $5 for Monthly Subscription.
26/05/2020, 19:05 - +91 72591 76020: oh
26/05/2020, 19:05 - +91 72591 76020: ya
26/05/2020, 19:05 - +91 72591 76020: stupid shit
26/05/2020, 19:05 - Aayush: All the pricing systems for all the newsletters and online specialised articles are copied from Thinking fast and Slow and therefore from one specific page from Predictably Irrational
26/05/2020, 19:08 - Aayush: Trust me at least 100 people in this country said that stuff in a board room and would have argued they be promoted for that idea.
26/05/2020, 19:10 - Aayush: Thinking it‚Äôs such a brilliant move that only s/he knows about it - Forgetting that it is also the exact same audience that read the same books s/he referred to get his/her pricing change, who need to pay for their subscription.
26/05/2020, 19:10 - Ujjwal Trivedi: <Media omitted>
26/05/2020, 19:13 - Jasnoor Gill: ü§£
26/05/2020, 19:14 - Aayush: Mini CEO virus
26/05/2020, 19:17 - +91 98203 02145: I just tweeted this https://twitter.com/gshewakr/status/1265268929309609984?s=21

I think substack is very different than the morning context / the Ken - one is institutional - the other is an individual relationship with a specific writer. They are experimenting with bundles, which will allow writers to come together and bundle subscriptions - I don‚Äôt think they will do it at a platform level. The best example of how this is going to pan out I think is here - https://divinations.substack.com/p/bundle-magic - Nathan & Dan bundled superorganizers and divinations
26/05/2020, 19:18 - Aayush: Yes the bundling is happening as we speak, in fact Ben Thompson just bundled with someone else
26/05/2020, 19:18 - Aayush: But if you extrapolate this forward, what‚Äôs the outcome?
26/05/2020, 19:19 - Aayush: You get a magazine - The more things change, the more they remain the same - However what happens is writers that get read and referred more get their due - It‚Äôs essentially a price discovery mechanism for writers.
26/05/2020, 19:19 - +91 99305 30939: Gruber
26/05/2020, 19:20 - +91 99305 30939: Gruber and Ben have same audience largely.
26/05/2020, 19:21 - +91 99305 30939: So bundling makes sense. Gruber never monetised before much but has a much larger readership
26/05/2020, 19:21 - Aayush: A magazine is a bundle of writers whose audience can pay for the authorship
26/05/2020, 19:22 - +91 72591 76020: It is not bundling, it is new content, new brands.
26/05/2020, 19:22 - Aayush: We have to realise why libraries exist or why magazine was invented
26/05/2020, 19:26 - Aayush: However I like the SubStack movement because it will let writers get some power lost to aggregators - Yet the economics of it won‚Äôt work out for the writer, clearly, overtime. But it‚Äôs a movement worth noticing. Like YTisation of written content, while remembering video is a very different medium than written content (Perhaps even video will be aggregated yet again on that note, even if more successfully than the written word).
26/05/2020, 19:27 - +91 99710 12339: Agree, how does a list in the digital world help?

What is a list used for? To note down items that customers want to shop for. Customers look at those items and shop in the offline world.

Deeper, do these lists vary a lot?
Grocery world - perhaps not. Folks tend to buy same set of items. There are deviations of course.

So is a grocery list helpful in the digital world?
New user - yes one time maybe. Deeper, unless items in the list are exact matches, do not see whether (metric wise) number of clicks per add to cart is reduced.
Repeat user - why need a list when hopefully, the platform has learnt enough to suggest the right items?

Not getting into UX and RoI etc.

Thoughts?
26/05/2020, 19:28 - +91 98203 02145: I think it‚Äôs tbd on how it plays out - but I think the end state could be a many-to-many mesh of relationships between writers where writers set their own prices; substack can probably help finding overlapping audiences and recommend writers to each other to partner - but the autonomy will remain with the writer - that‚Äôs substacks mission which they won‚Äôt dilute
26/05/2020, 19:29 - Aayush: Overlapping audiences = how to reduce costs of promotion = magazine = how to reduce cost of production = Massify the niche at some point (as always)
26/05/2020, 19:30 - Aayush: Yes I think the autonomy bit is correct
26/05/2020, 19:30 - Aayush: The writers are erudite enough to find their own price points overtime, will be interesting to watch
26/05/2020, 19:31 - Aayush: What if that‚Äôs the point - To make use of the notepad on the app as the buying note down list? Makes much more sense all of a sudden (huge leap of faith though)
26/05/2020, 19:33 - +91 72591 76020: People become brands, they make content on various channels, and make deals with Spotify if they are big enough :)
26/05/2020, 19:33 - +91 99710 12339: Who are the target users? New vs repeat - more for new?

Otherwise carts on almost all grocery platforms are a default list holder. Unless a cart is checkout out, it is a list?
26/05/2020, 19:34 - +91 99710 12339: Until a cart is checked out*
26/05/2020, 19:34 - Aayush: But there is no UX for it
26/05/2020, 19:34 - Aayush: At least not a listed UX
26/05/2020, 19:34 - Aayush: This helps that cause
26/05/2020, 19:34 - Aayush: Yes but look at the conditions for that to happen? Ends up being freemium.
26/05/2020, 19:35 - +91 99710 12339: Keep adding anything to cart. Till checkout. 

Maybe an instruction/suggestion label helps solve the use case.
26/05/2020, 19:35 - Aayush: Too long
26/05/2020, 19:35 - +91 99710 12339: As in?
26/05/2020, 19:35 - Aayush: Very arduous
26/05/2020, 19:35 - Aayush: Not in-your-face enough
26/05/2020, 19:35 - Aayush: (Remember audience)
26/05/2020, 19:38 - +91 72591 76020: True
26/05/2020, 19:38 - +91 99710 12339: Amount of time taken to 1) create a note pad list and search and then add vs 2) search/browse individually and then add - would be same perhaps.

Think users by default (atleast some of my research earlier had surfaced) use the cart as a list holder. 

Most grocery platforms force users to shop for a minimum amount. Kind of drives/influences that user behaviour.
26/05/2020, 19:40 - Aayush: Yes I agree there are many ways to solve the same problem but one closest to real life / akin to what the audience already does, if done well, might be an easier shift - Especially if the assumed audience is considered.
26/05/2020, 19:43 - +91 99710 12339: Possible. Fair.

Users in general choose least loaded path. Almost subconsciously.

Would be interesting to see if this feature drives any change.
26/05/2020, 19:44 - Aayush: If the comma was to be done away with by space, it would get a lot more response (but I think the comma is a necessity)
26/05/2020, 20:08 - Arjun Malhotra: I'm a big fan of the substack model. I think it helps surface really high quality, well-research and thoughtful writing. While paid aggregator models do a much better job than ad-supported, a thin layer of top writers can get away with direct monetisation.
Rather than making money, I also notice many writers use substack simply in order to own distribution with their readers (like an alternative to mailchimp) ‚Äì esp. having lost out during changes to content priorities on platforms like Google, fb, even Medium.

thought this added to the conversation above - https://hamish.substack.com/p/how-id-rebuild-print-media
26/05/2020, 20:15 - Kumar Rangarajan: We have been working on this for a while and here are our thoughts. 

There are two kinds of shoppers who exists - 

The supermarket shopper who looks for items one by one. Has a potential mental list and in many cases lots of on the spot decisions. 

The kirana store shopper. I remember how I did my monthly grocery item in my neighbor-hood shop. My mom gave me a list and I would just keep speaking out the list to the shop-keeper and he would then keep adding them to my list. 

The way my wife shops even today is a mix of both. She has a very clear set of items she wants to buy (she sometimes writes it down or remembers it - she is a doctor and can remember lot more things üòâ) 

The list model would work great if the UI could actually handle the list. Would be lot faster in some cases, where you are first dumping out your needs and then using the UI to select the actual SKU one by one.
26/05/2020, 20:23 - +91 99710 12339: 1. Agree on the kirana vs supermarket shopper though there are overlaps. Perhaps monthly/weekly vs daily/frequent shoppers give a more unique distinction.

2. Think the base questions are - 1) what is the exact need? 2) why  are current solutions suboptimal? 3) who are the target users 4) what would be the potential usage? 5) how is the new solution X times better (metric or otherwise)?

Could not find a reasonably +ve output for the feature through this filter.

3. UX/UI would triumph all of the above if a platform could magically tell me what I should buy and add them to my cart/deliver them to me.
26/05/2020, 20:46 - Kumar Rangarajan: When we were discussing this with one of the largest grocery players, the potential benefits were one of the following - 

* What is the fastest way to get people to get people to get to order placement instead of the "gradual cart building" that happens today. If there are quicker order placements with good volume in each of them, its better. 

* How do you potentially increase the size of the cart. By blurting out everything quickly, does it increase the total items being processed. 

* The target users in this case were power users. And its a matter of delight for them. 

Ofcourse the actual metric movement of each of them is unknown.
26/05/2020, 20:47 - Uday Product Folks: Need seo advice. Planning to launch a micro saas soon. Any reference on who should I talk to. Complete NOOB!
26/05/2020, 20:50 - Aayush: @919766149326
26/05/2020, 20:53 - Aayush: 1. Perfect so if we assume the same the TG decides the feature viability - The kirana shopper going online > the mall shopper

2. Ordering anything overtime frequently becomes a chore more than a pleasure - so saves time and mind space

3. The pleasure shopper is very evolved and wants to discover products via serendipity, which is a very different audience

The list solves for 1 and 2 very well, which leaving out the 3 for others - But just 3 is very difficult to survive on in the online world, 1 x 2, will survive and do well.
26/05/2020, 20:54 - Kumar Rangarajan: üëå
26/05/2020, 20:58 - +91 78287 80111: Big publishers are actually doing pay per article with this  Dutch startup Blendle, currently have customers in Netherlands and Germany. They have been around from 2014. Made headlines in US in 2016, but never really launched there fully. Unit economics not working out, they are pivoting to subscription model now.
26/05/2020, 21:05 - Arjun Malhotra: Blendle is fantastic! I used it for a long time but unfortunately they couldn't get enough publishers on
26/05/2020, 21:14 - +91 99978 63008: Folks using webflow or wix, have you seen any issue with uptime of site when not under the enterprise plan?
26/05/2020, 21:15 - +91 95552 25384: No. The limits are only on the form submissions that a project can receive and the CMS functionalities you can use. Uptime and speed have never been an issue. Form submissions have a slight issue wherein a call to an external api times out because of the default submit action. Just needs a small hack to fix that.
26/05/2020, 21:45 - +91 99710 12339: The first point is the base problem. Agreed. May have multiple solutions.

The second point - does it potentially increase the number of items processed? That's interesting. 

Trying to understand further - what is the principle or base logic at work here? As in, why would number of items shopped increase, if they were blurted out all at once? Is it because users tend to forget what they need to buy?
26/05/2020, 21:54 - +91 99710 12339: 1 is true.

2 is true too.

Did not get the relation between them and the list bit.

Following are probably assumptions
1 assumes that kirana shopper will always want to type out lists online and shop. We have shopped from kiranas and perhaps online as well? We exhibited the same behaviour?

2 assumes that items on lists have one-one mapping w/ products sold. Notwithstanding that high frequency + low variation grocery purchases data can be prompted. Need not refer to a list.
26/05/2020, 23:23 - Pankaj Chauhan: 2. "Ordering anything overtime frequently becomes a chore more than a pleasure" - absolutely agree - "so (list) saves time and mindspace" - I think this is a big assumption, maybe this is a need for a 0.01% of population that is pressed for time and want to optimize for minutes in their daily routine, but for average Joe, this is a huge assumption for a problem that they don't even have, i.e., optimising time and mindspace, rather, their problem seemed to be about putting in mindspace while they enjoy a far more seamless experience in physical stores or neighborhood kirana where they don't have to put any mind space at all, and about time, if saving time helped retail businesses in any way, they wouldn't be investing tremendous amout of effort to increase time spent and exploration inside the store. All of this had been my observation in past, whenever we tried to optimize time and mindspace in grocery shopper, it didn't make a single dent in the business in any way, but when we looked at physical stores and tried to bring the same experience while shopping on app, we saw the first major uptick in conversion and average order value without any extra discount or any increase in assortment
26/05/2020, 23:35 - Aayush: But that is the difference between online and offline
26/05/2020, 23:36 - Aayush: Buying something online is way more boring that buying something offline esp when it comes to FMCG
26/05/2020, 23:38 - Aayush: Fundamentally I believe this is one of the reason we end up resorting to discounting behaviour by default online much faster because the overall experience is much more value less and way more efficiency centric by default (and social commerce will, in someway we can‚Äôt imagine yet, fill this space).
26/05/2020, 23:38 - +91 99710 12339: +1 

because of limited ability to surface selection in one frame/view unlike offline.
26/05/2020, 23:42 - +91 99710 12339: Offline creates ways (shelves arrangement) to make customers browse as much as possible. Wonder though whether that leads to purchase variations across cycles
27/05/2020, 00:18 - Ujjwal Trivedi: While I agree for myself too. Am not sure that's a general fact - I guess people love discovering products online (for variety and guiltless window shopping at least).
27/05/2020, 00:20 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Discovering and shopping once either cc is configured or if COD is available. That friction still is huge.
27/05/2020, 00:21 - +91 99710 12339: In FMCG context too? Maybe some categories yes. Again, does love for discovery lead to shift in purchase patterns?
27/05/2020, 00:30 - Ujjwal Trivedi: It can, right? 
Only have a personal example: I started buying salads because all of them were available on BB, not in the shop next door.
27/05/2020, 00:31 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Again, don't know if that would be general behaviour, but high probability if you fulfill a *gap*.
27/05/2020, 00:31 - Aayush: Unique users
Frequency
Volume
Cart value

User researches once every N many times for most low touch products.

Everything becomes boring at scale when buying is seen as an efficiency exercise.
27/05/2020, 00:32 - Aayush: This has been answered many times - Look at financials of all the social commerce apps which wanted to scale checkouts.
27/05/2020, 00:33 - Aayush: Which the context is different, the objective with which an user comes to a website (context) matters a lot - If you can seamlessly tie discovery while improving purchase efficiency of a chore, it will work.
27/05/2020, 00:34 - Aayush: So you have to now ask how many such interesting sub-categories exist for this to happen.
27/05/2020, 00:34 - Pankaj Chauhan: "people love discovering products" - exactly, and that's precisely the challenge with mobile app shopping, making the discovery part "loving" rather than being a time efficient exercise
27/05/2020, 00:34 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Yeah, my interaction with  DailyNinja(now BB) is for convenience. Just click and schedule. Don't loiter around.
27/05/2020, 00:34 - Pankaj Chauhan: being just* a time efficient exercise
27/05/2020, 00:35 - Aayush: You will however loiter around / akin to shopper path offline / but only once every N many visits.
27/05/2020, 00:35 - Aayush: But the goal online has default become about efficient frequency.
27/05/2020, 00:36 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Because economy of scale doesn't kick in otherwise
27/05/2020, 00:37 - Aayush: There are ways of changing this but the cost is doing so will be huge.

The reason is works offline is because it is the native experience.

In kiranas it‚Äôs the uncle who suggests what‚Äôs new or what‚Äôs visible to your eye-line and you check it out.
27/05/2020, 00:37 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Yes.
27/05/2020, 00:37 - Aayush: Your field of view is much larger and much more experiential
27/05/2020, 00:38 - +91 99710 12339: Yes of course. Agreed completely.

How many times does one shift preferences, is the question
27/05/2020, 00:38 - +91 99710 12339: Not discounting relevance/benefits of browsing. The percentage is probably skewed towards convenience based shopping.
27/05/2020, 00:38 - Aayush: You can become the best experiential seller for Surf Excel
27/05/2020, 00:38 - Aayush: However after once you know you want Surf Excel you will optimise for efficiency of purchase and value
27/05/2020, 00:39 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Rare. Yes
27/05/2020, 00:39 - Aayush: So what‚Äôs the financial value of the experiential seller? Pretty big, lifecycle wise. But who benefits from it? The efficiency seller.
27/05/2020, 00:40 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Good summary.
27/05/2020, 00:42 - Aayush: Not very different in the offline world but it is at least little forgiving - However a easy way to look at it would be who is going bankrupt in the offline world right now? Not efficiency sellers. Economics ensures that efficiency sellers are must have, while others are only good to have.
27/05/2020, 00:48 - Aayush: However having said everything, this part what @919930906960 says is very true - This is the ultimately goal - Gamifying time spent while shopping - Dopamine giving equivalent of a socially endless scroll. 

To my mind the answer exists and the economic value of this answer might be very high but what is the cost of finding this answer? I don‚Äôt know. I certainly don‚Äôt think anyone in India is trying to solve this including every app in the social commerce segment, not their fault, it needs a much larger native language audience with much higher average disposable income.

A few experiments outside of India also have miserably failed for the most part.
27/05/2020, 01:12 - Pankaj Chauhan: From financial sense it's actually becomes much more important to drive more exploration by users when it comes to grocery, if online users just order necessary items, online portals will just shut down in long run as there is hardly any margin on those things, and the super efficient businesses which are in business of selling necessities, model their business around cost, and they manage to wrap up entire costs of business in % of GMV that is at times lesser than the % GMV put just in the marketing and promotions part in online businesses. Grocery E-commerce is a very high cost business model, with extremely low margin levels on most of the items, so to survive, e-grocers will have to figure out ways to sell Bedsheets and Sandwich makers to a user who came to order Aata and dal with a coupon code on checkout in a hurry.
27/05/2020, 01:16 - Aayush: Which is what is happening
27/05/2020, 01:17 - Abhishek Dey Hyperverge Product Head: Or introduce private labels
27/05/2020, 01:17 - Aayush: Not lucrative enough
27/05/2020, 01:17 - Aayush: Unless you are more than 50% of the market perhaps
27/05/2020, 01:17 - Aayush: Which is literally almost impossible
27/05/2020, 01:22 - +91 99375 36453: Why is that?

Grocery delivery firms have built a fair brand value amongst its users to launch private labels and scoop out fairly good margins.

I would not mind ordering a Big Basket branded item:).
27/05/2020, 01:24 - Aayush: Well the fundamental assumption is not true there
27/05/2020, 01:24 - Aayush: There is no brand value and there is hardly any loyalty
27/05/2020, 01:24 - +91 99375 36453: Interesting
27/05/2020, 01:24 - Aayush: I know saying this here is like ordering your own coffin but we will see this play out sooner than not
27/05/2020, 01:24 - Abhishek Dey Hyperverge Product Head: What if this is the only option available ? Given no brand loyalty
27/05/2020, 01:25 - +91 99375 36453: I have seen a lot of folks buying private labelled products from supermarkets.
27/05/2020, 01:25 - +91 99375 36453: Not sure of the numbers though
27/05/2020, 01:25 - Aayush: This is not about one brand or company or format, most digital companies in India have very bad loyalty and almost no brand value.
27/05/2020, 01:26 - Aayush: Again, which is what is happening or is tending to happen - However very tough in FMCG games.
27/05/2020, 01:26 - Aayush: All of us do, however the margins are not what we think in such products.
27/05/2020, 01:27 - Aayush: Co-branded products might have better margins in the longer run in fact
27/05/2020, 01:27 - Aayush: Which will also play out soon FYI
27/05/2020, 01:28 - Pankaj Chauhan: PL on most sold items will margin profile but only a bit, however, competing national brands with mammoth size operation on both price and quality doesn't add up, so quality drops and in order to push it you leave the pricing premium too, ending up with just slightly better margin profile which helps to show some improvement to investors but not even close to making it profitable
27/05/2020, 01:28 - Pankaj Chauhan: will improve*
27/05/2020, 01:28 - Aayush: Very well explained
27/05/2020, 01:34 - Aayush: But let me ask you a question since you think this way - What‚Äôs the test of brand value?
27/05/2020, 01:34 - Aayush: I.E. under what circumstances do you think there is brand value?
27/05/2020, 01:37 - +91 99375 36453: Care for the customers/users.

Most of the times, I've experienced their support/ops teams go beyond their capacity to ensure quality in terms of products, delivery, etc.

That trust with the brand is established. I can trust them if they launch a private label tomorrow.

P.S. Jotting this completely as a user. Others might have a different opinion.
27/05/2020, 01:37 - Aayush: Ok I am asking you a more generic question, not just ecommerce
27/05/2020, 01:37 - Aayush: Anything
27/05/2020, 01:38 - Aayush: What makes you believe something has brand value 
1) As a Consumer
2) As a business / product / brand person?
27/05/2020, 01:38 - Pankaj Chauhan: Problem is that when grocers try to go mass market, they unfortunately have to confront and match pricing of the likes of BigBazaar and DMart which world on EDLP model, i.e. not making money on items that pull the crowd, which happen to be majority of one's cart, which works fine for the chains because they pull in more than one third of GMV through very high margin items - General Merchandise, however, GM's % contribution in GMV of online grocers is something that makes investors eyes bleed
27/05/2020, 01:39 - Pankaj Chauhan: which work*
27/05/2020, 01:39 - +91 99375 36453: Fair explanation:)
27/05/2020, 01:41 - +91 99375 36453: 1) Trust built with the brand
2) If my users talk about the superiority of my products to their acquaintances. This can be measured via referrals.
27/05/2020, 01:42 - Aayush: How would this be quantified on a company‚Äôs balance sheet?
27/05/2020, 01:42 - Aayush: (Just bear with me for a moment)
27/05/2020, 01:44 - +91 99375 36453: Revenue.
27/05/2020, 01:45 - Aayush: Just to make it a little non-financial, let‚Äôs say profit (not revenue because you can increase revenue without increasing profits at all)
27/05/2020, 01:45 - Aayush: Agreed?
27/05/2020, 01:47 - +91 99375 36453: Haha
27/05/2020, 01:47 - +91 99375 36453: Yes
27/05/2020, 01:49 - Aayush: Brand is the ability to get higher profit margins without losing unique customers / in other words, pricing power
27/05/2020, 01:49 - Aayush: Almost everything else is actually negative value adding on the balance sheet (in economic terms)
27/05/2020, 01:50 - Aayush: Judge Indian startups by this and you suddenly realise what‚Äôs happening - Nobody has pricing power or the ability to get higher profit margins without losing unique customers.
27/05/2020, 08:26 - Praveen Inmobi: What about ease of recall which drives scale? and scale probably drives lower costs and hence higher profits
27/05/2020, 09:54 - +91 72591 76020: Since we were talking about Substack and more yesterday: https://bigtechnology.substack.com/p/on-leaving-buzzfeed-and-whats-next
27/05/2020, 10:16 - Bosky: On newsletters - It's definitely getting momentum and like any business transaction it's about value. This thread completely changed my views on newsletter
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14616440

I was surprised to hear examples of 
- stratechery btw makes $100k per month

But the killer ones are indie folks just solo writing like:

- Scott's cheap flights newsletter $300k+ per month

- hustle from Sam Parr has 1M+ subsbrivers - ad deals, apart from subscription leading to $20M+ in revenue

- newsletter for agritech investors making $1M+ 

- everything from Unix to movies to relationship advice. The ones making $10k per month is surprising.

- there are even communities for getting sponsors like upstart.me

I think more power to Ken, morning or anyone who wants to build a biz doing what they love to ppl who see value.

27/05/2020, 14:00 - Nachi: Its better to start with first principles
27/05/2020, 14:00 - Nachi: i.e look at your space, what are the activities people do
27/05/2020, 14:01 - Nachi: if an ott space, then how maby time they watch, how many minutes etc
27/05/2020, 14:01 - Nachi: then map it to usage, frequency, and quantity

27/05/2020, 17:18 - Suhas Motwani PM: Any Indian ones that have done invite only really well? (Not limited to SaaS)
27/05/2020, 17:23 - +91 95501 55983: I think a month ago they'd stopped accepting. So I entered the waitlist, didn't receive an invite yet! Will recheck if they've opened it somehow!

27/05/2020, 18:00 - +91 98190 07259: Thanks. Will reach out to you separately and explain further.
27/05/2020, 18:18 - +91 95609 85630: Hi there, 

Two of my friends from Stanford are attempting to change the way the world consumes content. They are building a platform for individuals to access the highest-quality, curated, and personalized content on the internet, and be part of meaningful, engaged communities. Knowledge-based content is highly disaggregated, with innumerable newsletters, Reddit, Twitter, YouTube, and podcasts. Initial traction for their currently invite-only platform has been very encouraging, and they've also begun building a high-quality, engaged community of dedicated users. Between them, the founders have experience across management consulting, investment banking, venture capital, and large-scale operations.

They're now looking for people to join them for: full-stack web development and app development, preferably with experience in ML roles. If your job‚Äôs joining has been delayed or you have time before pursuing MS / PhD, we would love to chat as well. I'd be happy to put you in touch with them if you or any of your friends are keen.  

Thanks!

27/05/2020, 20:37 - Maanav Investopad: Hey guys,

As this group is reaching its limit, we've been speaking with the mods and have decided to add another main group (PF 2) where all moderators and new members will be added.

Each proposed solution has its pros & cons, and this is not a perfect solution.
But ‚Äì until we look to move everything to Discord/Telegram/etc. ‚Äì we want to make sure everyone has access across groups and to conversations in each group so here's what we're doing:
1. Member lists and resources will be shared across both groups ‚Äì have been moved to a central Notion here: https://www.notion.so/teamhome3202/PF-Folks-9b16d0dfa5204811b613d1547da690f9
2. Summaries from both groups will be sent on the summary fork ‚Äì and available here: https://www.notion.so/teamhome3202/WhatsApp-Groups-summaries-6acff04c8a2f4c70992c033768178388
3. We're also going to be moderating more actively to ensure that relevant members and information is added to the respective forks. 
4. Developing clearer policies around moderation and better shared resources (e.g. for job boards).

Irrespective, there is a form that will be floated for a general feedback on the group, which will help us fill the gaps.  As always, feel free to PM me too.

Look forward to building this community stronger and better together üí™

Jabra 75t

Cheaper: skullkandy/oppo have options, dunno how good

27/05/2020, 22:12 - +91 91080 14100: TIL , the Airpods by themselves would have been a Fortune 500 company
27/05/2020, 22:12 - Jasnoor Gill: i went with airpods pro, no complaints. the noise cancelling is unique to them and sold me on it.
27/05/2020, 22:18 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Haha! Totally
27/05/2020, 22:31 - Arjun Malhotra: jabra anything is amazing. both 65t and 75t are great - they catch a lot of background noise though.

28/05/2020, 09:20 - +91 77618 44042: Big move/investment in to EV - does India have the infra to support EV charging requirements?
28/05/2020, 09:53 - +91 98861 70474: Not yet but the government is being fairly proactive in calling tenders for setting up public charging stations. Each metro / large city in every state has been assign a certain number of PCS as a target. They‚Äôve also put out regulations around distance thresholds, charging gun types (equivalent to type b vs type c etc). These are all within an urban setting but very little is being done on highways. 

AC vs DC chargers is another segmentation. AC chargers take 6-8 hours for an 80% charge whereas DC achieves the same in about 30-60 mins basis capacity. Cost-wise, they‚Äôre worlds apart. 

No standardisation of charging ports / guns too. India has decided to have their own standard (Tata and Mahindra use this) - EU has its own, china too, and of course tesla has a proprietary one. Too many variables still.
28/05/2020, 09:56 - +91 98861 70474: Hyderabad and Delhi I believe have a large number of PCS and electric vehicles per capita relatively speaking. 

The Hyderabad transport corporation has called an order for I believe 6k electric buses and want to replace their fleet entirely. Heaps of opportunity in this space but what happens in the post COVID world remains to be seen.
28/05/2020, 10:29 - Preetam Nath: Any way to escalate a Flipkart customer service request? 

A few doctors ordered AC for their room, it's hellish heat in campus rooms in Hyderabad, enough to fall sick. 

AC arrived a week ago. Installation guys are stalling or refusing to come since several days. Flipkart support is useless, everyday the response is "they will come, just wait" or "please give us 24h".
28/05/2020, 10:29 - Preetam Nath: FYI the technicians refuse to come when they find out that they have to enter hospital campus. Delivery people didn't seem to have that problem.
28/05/2020, 10:36 - +91 98190 07259: Preetam, my wife works in Flipkart. Please connect with me separately and lets see how can we help these docs

28/05/2020, 10:47 - +91 70328 02600: Are there any tools which aggregate messages across multiple slack workspaces? For e.g, a single pane view of messages @ to me in different workspaces

28/05/2020, 13:07 - +91 72591 76020: We were awesome till someone could out discount us, then everything fell apart.
28/05/2020, 13:07 - +91 72591 76020: The cynical TLDR
28/05/2020, 13:07 - Nachi: which indicates the lack of moats
28/05/2020, 13:08 - Nachi: or weak or artificial moats
28/05/2020, 13:08 - +91 72591 76020: I think companies need to go public faster, that will solve most of the problems
28/05/2020, 13:09 - +91 77618 44042: Or create new problems üò¨
28/05/2020, 13:09 - +91 72591 76020: I also think over-index moats. Moats are a mythical savior to out bad business. 

A good product is a moat in itself.
28/05/2020, 13:10 - +91 72591 76020: may be :)
28/05/2020, 13:10 - +91 96633 75213: I don't understand.. how? If there is no defensible business, why would anyone take a chance on it when there are businesses with better health out there?
28/05/2020, 13:11 - +91 96633 75213: Instead you invite extra governance that comes with being a public company
28/05/2020, 13:12 - +91 72591 76020: staying private longer = more VC money = Hide shit under the carpet called "valuation"
28/05/2020, 13:13 - +91 72591 76020: it is not a bad thing, can be managed.
28/05/2020, 13:13 - Nachi: i used to think that, and i was wrong
28/05/2020, 13:13 - Nachi: its a cross correlation or regression
28/05/2020, 13:18 - +91 96633 75213: From what I know, people will invest in your public company only if they have a reasonable return at reasonable risk. If there is significant risk, investors will wait it out till they see better quarterly numbers.

For most tech startups that are struggling to get to unit economic profitability, the Sauron will always be an Uber, Ola, Amazon etc. All it takes is for one of them to say 'this business is big enough' and drown customers in discounts. Standard winner take all formula in the digital space.

I don't know about others, but I for one wouldn't invest in a tech startup that went public unless I knew that money wasn't being used for short term gains.
28/05/2020, 13:19 - +91 96633 75213: There is a fundamental requirement of 'going concern' for a company to be investable. Very few of our startups today could stand to that scrutiny.
28/05/2020, 13:20 - +91 72591 76020: Correct. But they need to work towards it, rather and push the problem to the future self.
28/05/2020, 13:21 - Ujjwal Trivedi: This is the real TL;DR 1) In 2013, we mistook present for future. Delivery apps got better w scale. We got worse.

2) The profit equation was off. The market size in SF was too small for our big kitchen. We blitzfailed.

3) Cap Table + Burnout. Hard to restart after losing $50M.
28/05/2020, 13:23 - Ujjwal Trivedi: The optimism that you get lured in to, partly because of VC money- "We were running a restaurant doing $6M in revenue but paying real estate for a place that needed $20M in revenue to be profitable."
28/05/2020, 13:23 - +91 72591 76020: +100
28/05/2020, 13:23 - +91 98190 07259: There is an interesting read by Simon Sinek on making companies with an infinite mindset and not short term gains or to find a solution. He also references Friedman's article in the 1970s which gave birth to such bastard capitalism that makes VCs own the direction of the company and gives a free hand to founders to have arbitrary projections and layoffs
28/05/2020, 13:24 - +91 72591 76020: Reading this now. 100% great read
28/05/2020, 13:24 - +91 98190 07259: üôÇüëç
28/05/2020, 13:24 - +91 72591 76020: Btw, not all VC is bad vc, VC money can work with an infinite mindset
28/05/2020, 13:26 - +91 98190 07259: Yes, definitely. Depends on the founder though and his/her conviction towards the purpose of the company
28/05/2020, 13:27 - Preetam Nath: Scale solves unit economics and bad business fundamentals üòÇ
28/05/2020, 13:28 - Nachi: lot of vc business is assumption and projection
28/05/2020, 13:28 - Jasnoor Gill: Of course. If we lose 500rs/order at 10orders, we ll somehow magically be profitable at 5million orders üòú
28/05/2020, 13:28 - Nachi: there are proven businesses that do that @918105011844
28/05/2020, 13:29 - Nachi: take supr for example
28/05/2020, 13:29 - Nachi: if many people in the same apartment have subscribed
28/05/2020, 13:29 - Nachi: then it becomes immensely profitable
28/05/2020, 13:29 - Nachi: for only 2, its loss making per order
28/05/2020, 13:29 - Preetam Nath: Yeah agreed. That's the assumption, in case of Supr and their problem space, it's not a bad assumption.
28/05/2020, 13:30 - Nachi: so in cae od sprig the assumptions were wrong, execution was flaweds
28/05/2020, 13:30 - Nachi: any sane restaurant person would have said the rent to revenue
28/05/2020, 13:30 - Nachi: its not something unique, lot of in SF were warned not to pay sf prices at that exact time
28/05/2020, 13:31 - Nachi: i was there, i moved houses to run my company
28/05/2020, 13:31 - Nachi: it was either ignoring advice (vanity)
28/05/2020, 13:31 - Nachi: or bad founder market fit
28/05/2020, 13:31 - Nachi: sprig fyi heavily optimized for vanity metrics
28/05/2020, 13:32 - Nachi: its all to common in SF unfortunately. A pattern is finding someone who did well in business X
28/05/2020, 13:32 - Nachi: He goes to pitch business Y which is only tangentially related to X
28/05/2020, 13:32 - Nachi: He has VC friends or makes vc friends
28/05/2020, 13:33 - Nachi: aligns others who are in for a quick buck (the sf gold rush)
28/05/2020, 13:33 - Nachi: writes a couple of blogs which vcs celebrate as gold and call him an exper
28/05/2020, 13:33 - Nachi: *expert
28/05/2020, 13:33 - Nachi: few months and millions later, kaboosh
28/05/2020, 13:34 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: Would you say the same happened in 2014 wave of Flipkart alums starting up?
28/05/2020, 13:34 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Yes. It's all about that ratio and assumptions about it.
28/05/2020, 13:34 - +91 98190 07259: I see this happening in India too off late üòÄ

We want to leverage Whatsapp to do so. The idea is to make a bot on Whatsapp that 1) takes input from user of block/district 2) takes input from user of job type 3) fetches a list of contacts from a google sheet and 4) surfaces the list to the user. Exactly like Justdial on Whatsapp. Key thing is time to market (1 day). Any ideas on how we can achieve this.

29/05/2020, 16:44 - Nachi: interesting to see the bounce back

29/05/2020, 16:46 - Nachi: source?
29/05/2020, 16:53 - Nachi: also why so negative? unless you have magic 8 ball thats really magical, i personally find your comment not constructive.
29/05/2020, 16:54 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: I see a similar trend in Flipkart as well it‚Äôs back to BAU almost
29/05/2020, 16:56 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Wow, this is counterintuitive. May > Feb
29/05/2020, 16:56 - +91 99375 36453: ü§Øü§Ø
29/05/2020, 16:56 - Nachi: lower count higher value. one hypothesis is pent up spending
29/05/2020, 16:56 - +91 99375 36453: The difference in transaction count and amount is interesting
29/05/2020, 16:56 - +91 99375 36453: Luxury items being sold?
29/05/2020, 16:57 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Is it because of AC?
29/05/2020, 16:57 - Nachi: alternate hypothesis could be, people buying household things like dishwasher
29/05/2020, 16:57 - Nachi: which would be higher ticket items
29/05/2020, 16:57 - +91 99375 36453: ü§üü§ü
29/05/2020, 16:57 - +91 99375 36453: +1
29/05/2020, 16:57 - Fareed Sayed Flipkart: It‚Äôs also pent up demand .
29/05/2020, 16:58 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Also, what is %?? It's neither number not amount.
29/05/2020, 16:58 - Nachi: i dont think they want to give out the absolute numbers as a private company
29/05/2020, 16:58 - Ujjwal Trivedi: But % of ?
29/05/2020, 16:59 - Nachi: relative spend
29/05/2020, 16:59 - Nachi: i.e what % of spend is now back compared to feb
29/05/2020, 16:59 - Nachi: so they are taking feb as the benchmark 100% line
29/05/2020, 16:59 - Ujjwal Trivedi: % of pre-lockdown average as per tweet
29/05/2020, 17:00 - +91 98186 49039: My gut feel - ac, fridge, inverter, kitchen appliances would have driven this
29/05/2020, 17:00 - Nachi: would be interesting to know, anyone know PMs at pine labs to ask!
29/05/2020, 17:02 - Aayush: Not constructive? Lol
29/05/2020, 17:03 - Aayush: People didn‚Äôt buy a lot of stuff for 30-40 days which was then bought all of a sudden upon release
29/05/2020, 17:04 - Aayush: Purchase cycles are not magical ball like, they are linked to mostly two things: confidence overall economic growth and confidence in personal economic growth
29/05/2020, 17:04 - Ujjwal Trivedi: @917733889552 @919741336633 Does Razorpay see similar trends?
29/05/2020, 17:07 - Aayush: And on only certain channels because other channels don‚Äôt exist / not preferred
29/05/2020, 17:07 - Aayush: That doesn‚Äôt mean overall economy is BAU
29/05/2020, 17:08 - Preetam Nath: What's BAU?
29/05/2020, 17:08 - Aayush: Business-As-Usual
29/05/2020, 17:09 - Aayush: To understand economy look at markets which in aggregate do more than 50% in a category - UPI payments is a great example
29/05/2020, 17:10 - +91 72591 76020: They do digital too, so might be hard to decipher from their vantage point
29/05/2020, 17:10 - Jasnoor Gill: Yeah, this is pent up demand. With current economy, I doubt this'll sustain
29/05/2020, 17:13 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Mostly digital - but there should be correlation.
29/05/2020, 17:15 - Nachi: Customer testimonial for Jio Mart: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6670581964296204288/
29/05/2020, 17:20 - Nachi: `i am ambivalent. seems like there is something interesting happenning here. I am basing on other Payments data i am seeing. A lot of purchases are what one might consider luxury purchases
29/05/2020, 17:20 - +91 99305 30939: This is consumer durables data only. Is it really BAU for other categories?
29/05/2020, 17:21 - Aayush: Even this will fall, perhaps harder
29/05/2020, 17:22 - Aayush: It‚Äôs not particular to India per se
29/05/2020, 17:24 - +91 99305 30939: Yes agree. People are just buying things they'll need to make their WFH comfortable for the next 2 years, and some of it is pent-up demand too (broken Phone, laptop, electronics in last 3 months now being replaced in one go)
29/05/2020, 17:24 - +91 98186 49039: Wouldn't the perception of luxury goods also have changed? AC would have turned from being a luxury good to an essential good to a person if they are spending 100% of their time, for someone living in Delhi-NCR weather. Same with inverters
29/05/2020, 17:24 - +91 97413 36633: We prepared this report last month: https://razorpay.com/blog/report-coronavirus-covid19-impact-digital-payments/
Impact was limited - thanks to growth in some segments like Donations, Utilities, OTT, etc.
29/05/2020, 17:25 - Preetam Nath: Exactly what I'm doing and exactly what people I know are doing
29/05/2020, 17:25 - +91 72591 76020: So the chart is only tier 1 cities, and does not include Delhi & Mumbai
29/05/2020, 17:26 - +91 72591 76020: largely folks who can afford stuff, and may not be hit hard

29/05/2020, 19:23 - +91 99305 30939: The ratio is calculated as e-comm/(e-comm + retail). Retail had reduced so e-comm share has grown.
29/05/2020, 19:23 - Aayush: Yep

30/05/2020, 09:24 - Preetam Nath: Serious Q. Is everyone's experience with Fk Support similar or is this an isolated incident?

I've made 90% of my online purchases from Amazon in past 3-4 years and in that time I've faced in terms of volume as many bad experiences with Amazon as I have with Flipkart.
30/05/2020, 09:38 - +91 70421 13077: Hello ü§ùü§ùü§ù
30/05/2020, 09:49 - +91 99020 11644: This incident seems to be more about Voltas than flipkart
30/05/2020, 09:51 - Preetam Nath: If I pay you X for a good or service, I hold you accountable

Similar to how I'd hold urban company accountable if their lead for hairdresser screwed up?

31/05/2020, 09:25 - +91 99020 11644: Don‚Äôt waste your time with a designer. Use the free tools out there. Wix has a great one. You can iterate through many very quickly. 
Finally if you settle on an idea that you want to spruce up, take it to a designer.
31/05/2020, 09:26 - +91 99020 11644: I‚Äôve done this way too often in the past

Hello everyone, Ankit here! 
I‚Äôm currently working with Zeta as a product manager contributing to their Banking-as-a-service product. 

Prior to this I‚Äôve worked with InMobi & SAP labs as an engineer where I got my first exposure to building highly scalable platforms. After doing that for ~5 years, I decided to get an MBA from ISB. 

Besides, technology I‚Äôm also passionate about music. Happy to be part of this group! (Noticed a few familiar faces)
Looking forward to contributing in a meaningful way. :)

01/06/2020, 13:02 - +91 98101 12831: That won't help
01/06/2020, 13:03 - +91 99375 36453: Curious question: The Ken uses a text format for its blogs. The morning context on the other hand either does image upload or has put up restrictions on copying the text (highly unlikely). How did you manage to create that Evernote?
01/06/2020, 13:04 - +91 98186 49039: Maybe you will be the cause that unites them.
01/06/2020, 13:05 - +91 99375 36453: Bingo! The lawyers involved already don't like you.
01/06/2020, 13:06 - Ankit Pansari: Exactly. I don't know. To be honest, this is the only reason I am still paying for Evernote
01/06/2020, 13:06 - Ankit Pansari: Their clipper is the best.
01/06/2020, 13:07 - Ankit Pansari: Morning Context has restrictions on copying text.
01/06/2020, 13:07 - +91 98101 12831: Platforms like The Ken, Morning Context need a better model.
Look at the scoring based on what I surveyed a couple of weeks ago: https://twitter.com/SparklinGuy/status/1263066209366364160
01/06/2020, 13:07 - +91 99375 36453: Yusss
01/06/2020, 13:07 - Ankit Pansari: I think the tech is  something like Pocket. Where they first take the text HTML element from the source and then save it.
01/06/2020, 13:08 - Ankit Pansari: Maybe only <h> and <p> files
01/06/2020, 13:08 - +91 98101 12831: You can also try archive.is

01/06/2020, 14:56 - +91 99305 30939: This is a difficult problem. OLX has become almost ununsable these days due to fraudsters. But can Telcos fix this? Also, I'm not sure if PayTm would win this case.
01/06/2020, 14:59 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: But good that someone is taking this up. TRAI and govt have effectively failed to do anything against phishing.
01/06/2020, 15:07 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Not sure if this can actually fix phishing problem. When the attack happened from one Paytm account to another then what action Paytm took against that fraudster. Money flows from one account to another. Hence there is always an audit trail. How many complaints did Paytm filed against fraudsters and got them behind bars.
Tomorrow fraudsters will start sending from international gateways then what will Paytm do.
01/06/2020, 15:08 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Jamtara!
01/06/2020, 15:09 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Surely Himanshu it's not a problem with others. Paytm need to fix their own house first
01/06/2020, 15:11 - Jasnoor Gill: Same Issue with upi/bank debit cards etc as well, no?
01/06/2020, 15:11 - Sumit Flight Product Ixigo: Yeah agree. And that is the reason a stricter framework around the phishing
01/06/2020, 15:12 - +91 99870 94433: looks like paytms running out of ways to make news ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
01/06/2020, 15:15 - +91 99305 30939: I think it's a problem with everyone. Just look at OLX frauds which happen not just with Paytm but also with Gpay etc.

01/06/2020, 17:08 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Absolutely. Max frauds are happening through collect request. Hence platforms need to fix how collect requests are handled. Tomorrow paytm will blame internet for fraud ü§£ü§£ü§£

02/06/2020, 21:09 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: On a serious note...how this person got a number of US ? Whatsapp requires OTP to be entered....any idea ?
02/06/2020, 21:09 - Preetam Nath: Get a virtual number via Twilio, read incoming message logs to verify the OTP -- voila, you have a WhatsApp account on a number you acquired 1 minute ago
02/06/2020, 21:10 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Oh ok
02/06/2020, 21:11 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: So there is an audit trail available to catch this guy. If this is a virtual number. Only if the government wanted to üòûüòû
02/06/2020, 21:15 - Preetam Nath: WhatsApp usually bans such numbers in a few days. It's short lived, but enough time to cause havoc yes
02/06/2020, 21:17 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Yes...if whatsapp blocks one you can take another...very difficult to trace...
02/06/2020, 21:17 - Preetam Nath: True. Flip side is a hyperactive anti-spam AI that bans too many users including legit ones. Difficult problem to solve I suppose
02/06/2020, 21:18 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: Not for whatsapp to solve. Everything cannot be solved using AI and machine learning. Npci has to block collect requests
02/06/2020, 21:21 - Nimish Jain Whatsapp Jio: See we know the government for some reason doesn't want to solve this problem. The medium has to be blocked. NPCI need to proactively stop UPI collect requests. Else the whole digital ecosystem goes for a toss...online scams will cause people to move away from digital economy
02/06/2020, 23:57 - +91 99305 30939: TextNow app will give you a US phone number. You'll get its OTP too.

03/06/2020, 13:19 - Ujjwal Trivedi: That's actually useful and related to phone usage. Finding apps based on country of origin has nothing to do with Phone.
03/06/2020, 13:20 - Ujjwal Trivedi: And is discriminatory. Tomorrow, it would allow grounds for identifying apps based on caste and color of creator.
03/06/2020, 13:24 - +91 99375 36453: This sounds more Indian
03/06/2020, 13:26 - +91 98186 49039: Not related, but at some point in my career, I was in a meeting with an image science startup where a senior exec from my company at that point asked them if you can identify and remove product images from clothing category where the models are ugly. This was followed by the most uncomfortable silence ever for the next one minute. :/
03/06/2020, 13:27 - +91 98186 49039: The executive in question clarified then that they are looking for non professional photos taken by merchants themselves. Still no redemption for the original remark.

However, with lockdown restrictions slowly being eased and traffic movement improving on National Highways, the FASTag revenues have grown to Rs 1,140 crore in May 2020."

03/06/2020, 21:27 - Jasnoor Gill: Yeah, my cred app agrees. I am personally down more than that, excluding an ecomm demand bump in the last week to order wfh stuff
03/06/2020, 21:27 - +91 99305 30939: April was lowest. But May has picked up from Fastag data above.
03/06/2020, 21:29 - Aayush: There are two kinds of problems:
Supply side
Demand side

May solves supply side
But the demand side, esp the white collar demand side, will contract further
03/06/2020, 21:29 - Aayush: This is also assuming all this opening up doesn‚Äôt end up to more close up a month later
03/06/2020, 21:29 - Aayush: If that happens both suffer even more
03/06/2020, 21:47 - +91 99305 30939: That's fair. I'm just saying don't look at April data alone as that was the bottom due to full lockdown.
03/06/2020, 21:48 - Aayush: Yes April would be bottom on a lot of aspects, minus white collar salaries

"SBI Card said that spends on credit cards continued during lockdown through online and merchant outlets open during this period. Post-relaxation of lockdown, average daily spreads in May is trending at ‚Çπ175 plus crore against ‚Çπ290 plus crore in the January-March quarter. The daily spend level in last seven days of May is trending ‚Çπ200 plus crore. SBI Card is now averaging at 60 per cent plus of the pre-lockdown daily average spend. Online spends in January-March were 44 per cent of the total retail spends, which is trending at 55 per cent of the total spends in May.

The top online categories are departmental stores and groceries (D&G), utilities and services, and top point of sale categories are D&G, fuel, electronics and health and wellness. While certain categories of spends such as travel, dining and lodging have remained weak, new categories such as education, online health and pharmacies have come up."

Not sure at what stage Udaan Pay is at, but I won't be surprised to see it getting pushed to the users.

04/06/2020, 11:46 - +91 72591 76020: It works for Google Pay or Maps, you are adding value to your current users.

04/06/2020, 11:58 - +91 72591 76020: Frankly I don't, but it is just wrong. You know have to serve all the needs of the kirana store and the end user.

Could this have been done in an easier manner? Making sure the relationship between store and end consumer remains direct?

Which is why I raised the Shopify point
04/06/2020, 11:59 - +91 72591 76020: listen to this: http://investorfieldguide.com/tobi-lutke-building-a-modern-business-invest-like-the-best-ep-173/
04/06/2020, 12:10 - +91 99375 36453: Agreed. But, I guess they're too young in the ecosystem to have built a direct relationship in the very beginning. At least, they're trying it now:).
04/06/2020, 12:10 - +91 99375 36453: Yes Sir:)
04/06/2020, 12:21 - +91 72591 76020: But they have been there long enough to know the "business" they are in. 

And I am not picking on them, this is an issue for many startups, they don't know the business they are in.

04/06/2020, 14:58 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Haha! btw, there is a fork for fun stuff.
04/06/2020, 15:45 - Aayush: Go one step further please
04/06/2020, 15:47 - Aayush: Facebook global moves are similar: https://about-fb-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/about.fb.com/news/2020/06/gojek-investment-indonesia-small-businesses/amp/
04/06/2020, 15:47 - Aayush: Same moves globally
04/06/2020, 15:47 - +91 88617 98719: The planned investment, if completed, would mean Amazon acquiring a roughly 5 percent stake based on the current market value of Bharti, which is India's third-largest telecoms company with more than 300 million subscribers.
https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/amazon-in-talks-to-buy-2-billion-stake-in-bharti-airtel-5359581.html
04/06/2020, 15:48 - Aayush: Hahaha
04/06/2020, 15:56 - Aayush: These are becoming extremely predictable. Was talking to some people in May and the conclusion was Amazon + Airtel would happen - Mostly basis culture and some basis mutual gain.
04/06/2020, 15:56 - +91 72591 76020: Culture? O.o
04/06/2020, 15:56 - Aayush: These are very significant moves, will change industry structure in a big way in times to come
04/06/2020, 15:57 - +91 91084 44561: Which one? How does one discover all these forks?
04/06/2020, 15:57 - Aayush: Yeah. I know sounds odd.

04/06/2020, 16:02 - +91 77338 89552: This is nice!
04/06/2020, 16:02 - +91 77338 89552: Are these groups active?
04/06/2020, 16:10 - Aayush: Yes, mostly
04/06/2020, 16:11 - +91 77338 89552: Ok üëç
04/06/2020, 16:27 - +91 97571 63031: What's the reasoning behind these investments? In the Jio / FB partnership, there were some synergies between WhatsApp and JioMart. But with Google/Idea and Amazon/Airtel, is it purely a financial investment? Are these stocks really the best use of the tech companies cash?
04/06/2020, 16:31 - +91 72591 76020: - Easier access to more data
- Easier to Lobby 
- Fangs digging in > moats around you :P
04/06/2020, 16:32 - Aayush: They are, this would have happened.
04/06/2020, 16:32 - Aayush: I wrote about this back in 2014. It was that evident to someone working in the industry (I was with Airtel)
04/06/2020, 16:33 - +91 99020 11644: Closer to customer
Free internet and access to Amazon or Facebook etc. Jio is already doing this. This is against the principal of Net Neutrality
04/06/2020, 16:33 - Aayush: Telecom is the largest base of customer information by a huge margin. In terms of information value, telecom beats everyone else, including social media.
04/06/2020, 16:34 - Aayush: Next is banking, which would trigger more easier anti-trust.
04/06/2020, 16:34 - +91 99020 11644: This has been predicted for sometime. It might be interesting to see if Govt objects to a takeover
04/06/2020, 16:34 - Aayush: Therefore telecom is a better smarter way in.
04/06/2020, 16:34 - +91 99020 11644: There is sufficient anti-trust / net neutrality issues here
04/06/2020, 16:34 - Aayush: 5%
Covid times
No chance
04/06/2020, 16:35 - +91 99020 11644: What I meant is if they accrete ownership over 50% ie a takover
04/06/2020, 16:35 - +91 99020 11644: otherwise whats the point
04/06/2020, 16:35 - Aayush: No that won‚Äôt happen
04/06/2020, 16:35 - +91 99020 11644: Do I get special favours as a shareholder?
04/06/2020, 16:35 - Aayush: This message was deleted
04/06/2020, 16:35 - Aayush: Of course
04/06/2020, 16:36 - +91 99020 11644: Thats a huge conflict of interest
04/06/2020, 16:36 - Aayush: These are equal footed partnerships
04/06/2020, 16:36 - Aayush: Well startups saying this is a little hypocritical
04/06/2020, 16:37 - +91 99020 11644: haha
04/06/2020, 16:37 - Aayush: The whole premise of non-transaction businesses is information sharing while skirting laws
04/06/2020, 16:39 - +91 99020 11644: Touche @919738199828
04/06/2020, 16:39 - +91 99020 11644: For instance I wouldn't give discounted pricing to a shareholder
04/06/2020, 16:39 - Aayush: Sure, your investor would
04/06/2020, 16:39 - Aayush: / at some point make it happen
04/06/2020, 16:40 - Aayush: It‚Äôs not strange, it‚Äôs just what we all have allowed and if it‚Äôs allowed it will happen
04/06/2020, 16:40 - Aayush: Like there is a clamour for tax evasion via Mauritius on the Flipkart deal recently, where a lot of funds are saying if you do this then etc etc etc
04/06/2020, 16:42 - Aayush: It‚Äôs completely correct for IT to do this, this is not akin to the Vodafone case.

But that doesn‚Äôt mean people won‚Äôt want to evade taxes.
04/06/2020, 16:48 - Aayush: Having said that, telecom + banking + ecommerce will happen. They have too many synergies that benefit each other. Rather than trying to stop it, one should create a lot of competition and watch it play.
04/06/2020, 16:49 - Aayush: (Facebook is also ecommerce, with a news feed as front)

Folks, I am Abhishek, and I oversee Product at Pratilipi. Pratilipi is India's largest reading and writing platform. Hoping to interact/discuss on product/business topics with you guys üôè
04/06/2020, 17:18 - Suhas Motwani PM: Welcome @917743869475 :)
04/06/2020, 17:18 - +44 7867 389889: Thanks @919916315081 , it‚Äôs my pleasure to be part of an active product community.

I come with a some deep understanding of commercialising SaaS products alongside strengths in Product Management.

Worked across quite a few heavy weights like McLaren and General Electric, more recently had exits as CTO and recent led a EMEA merger with ServiceNow.

I now consult with a leading eCommerce brand here in London and looking to move back to Bangalore.

04/06/2020, 18:14 - +44 7867 389889: Anything particularly interesting ?
04/06/2020, 18:14 - Aayush: Yes lots of ecommerce folks here
04/06/2020, 18:15 - Aayush: So it will be a good addition
04/06/2020, 18:15 - +44 7867 389889: ah ha.... India e-commerce is flooded, our customer journeys here are not as insanely addictive as its out there
04/06/2020, 18:19 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Well, I had a rather boring reason. I save contacts that way. üòÄ But good to know, will be great to learn the differences between .in and .uk consumer behaviors.
04/06/2020, 18:20 - +44 7867 389889: lol.... this is a good one, made me chuckle.

04/06/2020, 19:14 - Preetam Nath: https://twitter.com/shivamsharma/status/1268513999831724032?s=09

Working at Unacademy taught me the value and importance of distribution, and also a crazy but predictable way to go about it.
04/06/2020, 19:14 - Aayush: What‚Äôs your view on this @919008767748 : #6 Play the Game: Building a startup is a *multi-innings* game. Play like you want to be the best player! Again, remember, multi-innings. Don't optimise only for the short term.
04/06/2020, 19:18 - Preetam Nath: Not sure what exactly he's referring to here. my hunch - trying to be a founder isn't a one attempt and done thing. Small number of founders achieve unicorn level success in first attempt. most others are on their 2nd, 3rd, .. Nth attempt. Cue Travis Kalanick. Maybe that's what he's referring to.

At least, that's the conclusion I draw from my own life philosophy. Play long term games where every additional exposure increases the odds of success in long term. i.e. lucky overnight success after 10 years of hard work
04/06/2020, 19:19 - Aayush: What about different stages of a startup and funding as different innings?
04/06/2020, 19:20 - Preetam Nath: Possible. Challenges and requirements are different at every stage
04/06/2020, 19:20 - Aayush: But, yet, a lot of us, apparently, hate Travis for so many things now.
04/06/2020, 19:21 - Jasnoor Gill: Building a startup takes time, not an overnight thing. Most people underestimate how long and how much work
04/06/2020, 19:21 - Preetam Nath: That's alright. He's a billionaire he couldn't give a hoot
04/06/2020, 19:21 - Nachi: for the SaaSpreneurs here: 
https://board.first100users.com/
04/06/2020, 19:22 - +91 99870 94433: overnight success takes 10 years - VSS
04/06/2020, 19:22 - Nachi: i think lot of us hate Travis for what he did after achieving success
04/06/2020, 19:22 - Aayush: In which case Mark Zuckerberg or Jeff Bezos or Ambani are only optimising for the long run from their POV - If it‚Äôs legally allowed, it‚Äôs to be done.
04/06/2020, 19:22 - Preetam Nath: While I do not condone misdeeds by Travis Kalanick, it's impossible to do something meaningful at scale in this world without haters. Cue Bill Gates Foundation
04/06/2020, 19:22 - Jasnoor Gill: Travis to be fair, was moderately successful preUber
04/06/2020, 19:23 - Jasnoor Gill: He already had an exit to akamai
04/06/2020, 19:23 - Jasnoor Gill: Just not that well known
04/06/2020, 19:23 - Aayush: Relativity
04/06/2020, 19:23 - Aayush: Perfect. Just wanted to understand your perspective here. Given other debates on the matter earlier.
04/06/2020, 19:23 - Nachi: i have worked with Travis, the early days travis to post morgan stanley/PIF were very different people
04/06/2020, 19:24 - Aayush: This message was deleted
04/06/2020, 19:24 - Aayush: That‚Äôs interesting so between both the later guy was more successful in worldly terms?
04/06/2020, 19:25 - Nachi: dont know how to qualify, the 1st guy built a billion dollar business
04/06/2020, 19:25 - Nachi: the second guy raised a billion dollars in funding
04/06/2020, 19:25 - Nachi: and eventually lost his company
04/06/2020, 19:25 - Aayush: Interesting perspective
04/06/2020, 19:26 - Aayush: May be just optimised for outcomes the world wanted
04/06/2020, 19:26 - Aayush: At its own right time
04/06/2020, 19:26 - Nachi: i think i have seen this change of persona with a handful of successful entrepreneurs
04/06/2020, 19:27 - Nachi: Nick Woodman of Go Pro
04/06/2020, 19:27 - Nachi: Travis
04/06/2020, 19:27 - Nachi: Zuck
04/06/2020, 19:27 - Aayush: How would your define the change?
Is it like more autocratic or more devil-may-care attitude? More control in absolute?
04/06/2020, 19:29 - Nachi: i am finding it hard to articulate
04/06/2020, 19:29 - Nachi: i find it hard to think in term of dichotomy
04/06/2020, 19:29 - Nachi: but some key things noticed
04/06/2020, 19:29 - Nachi: Shift from Empathy to Apathy towards people
04/06/2020, 19:30 - Nachi: from humble arrogance to more arrogance with less humility
04/06/2020, 19:30 - Nachi: maybe drinking their own kool aid too much
04/06/2020, 19:32 - Aayush: Could it be that when you are smaller outcomes are derived from democracy and when you are bigger outcomes are derived from autocracy, as perceived by these well known founders?

Whether this perception is true or not is a different issues, because that is decided by the market and share holding outcomes more than other things.
04/06/2020, 19:33 - Aayush: (Sorry guys didn‚Äôt take it to public policy fork because the discussion has been mostly about founder attributes leading to success and vice versa more than public policy, which is a different topic)
04/06/2020, 19:33 - Nachi: dont quite in full agreement with what you said
04/06/2020, 19:33 - Nachi: i see it as a more relationship with $$$
04/06/2020, 19:33 - Aayush: So only partial agreement?
Because of $ outcome.
04/06/2020, 19:34 - Nachi: and people influencing yuo
04/06/2020, 19:34 - Vikas: "You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain" - Harvey Dent, The Dark Knight
04/06/2020, 19:34 - Jasnoor Gill: Success often breeds its own brand of arrogance
04/06/2020, 19:34 - Jasnoor Gill: Or the feeling of being right always, or not needing to listen to feedback etc
04/06/2020, 19:35 - Aayush: All these lines are great however only share price value gives money to talk about these things while people tweet
04/06/2020, 19:35 - Nachi: :)
04/06/2020, 19:35 - +91 72591 76020: Plug: infinite game the book
04/06/2020, 19:36 - Aayush: And others die in want of food, as people debate about the goodness of goodness.
04/06/2020, 19:36 - +91 72591 76020: People and companies who work for a cause last longer than those who work for a goal
04/06/2020, 19:36 - Nachi: if outcome is building a great company, then you still focus on people. (cue Tony Hsieh, Jeff B, Chesky ,Tobi etc)
04/06/2020, 19:37 - Aayush: Looks like infinite money more than infinite game
04/06/2020, 19:37 - Nachi: but having huge capital advantage, changes perspective
04/06/2020, 19:37 - Aayush: Chesky is an interesting addition
04/06/2020, 19:37 - Nachi: when you can buy a expert, you dont see its worth the time in investing your people more
04/06/2020, 19:37 - Nachi: maybe
04/06/2020, 19:37 - Preetam Nath: +100

I think the way founders turn out is very personal to their life and journey experiences and personalities. That's why we have Zuck & Tobi, both billionaire founders who (from an outsider perspective) are so different.
04/06/2020, 19:38 - Nachi: there was a book by Ben Horowitz about it recently i read
04/06/2020, 19:38 - Nachi: forget the name
04/06/2020, 19:38 - Aayush: That‚Äôs possibly because when you have money, you can follow your philosophy better.
04/06/2020, 19:38 - +91 99020 11644: Wasn‚Äôt Prukalpa on this whatsapp group?
04/06/2020, 19:39 - Nachi: will tell you when i have a few 100 millions
04/06/2020, 19:39 - Nachi: focussed on the first part for now :P
04/06/2020, 19:39 - Aayush: Exactly
04/06/2020, 19:39 - Jasnoor Gill: That's also different across US/India. Lesser $ required in India ;)
04/06/2020, 19:39 - Aayush: Frameable comment that.
04/06/2020, 19:40 - Jasnoor Gill: 10s of millions and you are thereüò¨
04/06/2020, 19:40 - Nachi: 10s of millions isnt fuck you money anymore
04/06/2020, 19:41 - Preetam Nath: Yes agreed. But it's enough to not care about what anyone says or does for the rest of one's life :D

Just don't buy an island and a helicopter, and you're good.
04/06/2020, 19:41 - Aayush: No money is F U money - Bill, Zuck, Bezos, Ambani, <Insert fav here>
04/06/2020, 19:42 - Nachi: 750 million according a research i rea
04/06/2020, 19:42 - Preetam Nath: Curious, what's the number people have in their minds when they think complete financial freedom. I'm very vocal about it in private conversations, it's $10mn for me.

I can't see a way to not get corrupt if I continue pursuing after that. See Jeff Bezos optimising to make $100bn into $200bn.
04/06/2020, 19:42 - Nachi: thats the FU money threshold
04/06/2020, 19:43 - Aayush: We might be wasting other people‚Äôs time here - some fork?
04/06/2020, 19:43 - Aayush: (As a side note: Per capita average vs multiple, F U is part of that journey)
04/06/2020, 19:44 - Aayush: But yeah less F U than others, sure, I mean on a moral scale, if morality is a scale at all - Not sure if it matters though.
04/06/2020, 20:26 - Anuj Gupta: These figures are funny because through revealed preferences (i.e. how much we're willing to pay to save our own life), humans value their life between $100k (lower income countries) to $10M (richest countries).
04/06/2020, 20:29 - Ankit Pansari: Why are tech companies suddenly buying stake in Indian  telcos? Is there some news of net neutrality getting revoked?
04/06/2020, 20:30 - Aayush: (Auto-revoked since Jio came)
04/06/2020, 20:32 - Ankit Pansari: Considering that might be only way to save the debt structure of Indian telcos.
04/06/2020, 20:32 - Aayush: (Hence auto-revoked)
04/06/2020, 20:32 - Aayush: Crony socialism works in mysterious ways
04/06/2020, 20:32 - Aayush: I mean not-so-mysterious
04/06/2020, 20:56 - +91 96633 75213: $1M for me, $10M just as a stretch goal.

I used to have it as Rs. 2 Crore, 12L / year is quite sufficient for a middle class existence.
04/06/2020, 20:59 - Preetam Nath: Same! Floor is $1mn, ceiling is $10mn :D
04/06/2020, 21:00 - +91 99870 94433: So you're giving away anything past $10 mm? Will DM.
04/06/2020, 21:00 - Aayush: Lol
04/06/2020, 21:02 - Preetam Nath: I'll stop trying to earn more // spend 100% of time doing things I love without any goal of earning from it. Earning will be a byproduct

IDK what I'll do with the extra money. Simply distributing it won't be efficient use of capital. Create structures that enable more people to become entrepreneurs and successful at it, is what comes to mind.
04/06/2020, 21:03 - +91 99870 94433: So we're raising a round...
04/06/2020, 21:03 - Aayush: How is different from others? They are doing the same. All of them.
04/06/2020, 21:03 - Preetam Nath: Same as in?
04/06/2020, 21:04 - +91 70328 02600: Alternate perspective - https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1268440992375603202?s=19
04/06/2020, 21:06 - Jai Quickride: Curious - what made you raise it? 
In addition to inflation of course :P
04/06/2020, 21:07 - Aayush: <Media omitted>
04/06/2020, 21:16 - Preetam Nath: Wealth inequality is real and widening. Will the solution come from billionaires saying, I want to make less? Or from structural changes from govt to better distribute gains of a few to masses -- yet without disturbing the balance too much because if there's not a large enough incentive, people like Bezos won't bother to grow their company to billions in the first place
04/06/2020, 21:29 - Nachi: is a billion dollar company better than say 10 100mn companies from a societal standpoint? (asking genuinely)
04/06/2020, 21:32 - Preetam Nath: I have not researched any papers but I have believed and expressed that I'd rather see 1 million million-dollar businesses than 1 hundred billion dollar business
04/06/2020, 21:32 - Preetam Nath: (pls excuse if math is off by a 0 üò¨)
04/06/2020, 21:32 - +91 98190 07259: Yes, the one billion dollar company usually brings a change in habit/mindset for the better
04/06/2020, 21:37 - +91 96633 75213: So, I came up with 2 Crores as a number when I was 25 and single.. looking at my general spend at that time, I wasn't crossing 50k a month. So I thought 1L should be more than enough money, to do whatever I wanted. 

I'm now 36, and I realise that you need to account for expenses as a married couple with aging parents, and inflation. That's why the number moved up to $1M.

Honestly, i still think I can make do with 18L a year even now, I have very simple tastes - growing up middle class and not being acquainted with the taste of being rich has its benefits (or blind spots as some may call it). I say blind spot because it's only when you get to stay at a Hilton that you realise how (comparitively) bad an OYO is. Or taking a flight to Hyderabad instead of a bus.

It frightens me though, that a few people I know who are 45+ also have had $1M in their sights, and are maybe just 50% of the way there, despite holding really senior designations in very reputable companies (e.g. Microsoft ). Kind of tells me that this is a goal that isn't easy to reach no matter how high you are in an organization as an employee.
04/06/2020, 21:40 - +91 6361 304 501: in the US or india?  The average american has lifetime earnings of about USD 2m
04/06/2020, 21:40 - Anuj Gupta: Why would it necessarily be for the better?
04/06/2020, 21:41 - +91 96112 56611: with a low inflation and reducing employment opportunities all over. 
Would you think that actually there is no retirement possible? 
That a consistent flow of income >> big source of income.
That investing in health and continous low risk employability will lead to a more fulfilling time rather than a steep hustle?
04/06/2020, 21:42 - Anuj Gupta: imho probably not. De-monopolization, resilience, etc.
04/06/2020, 21:44 - +91 96633 75213: +1
04/06/2020, 21:44 - +91 98190 07259: In my opinion, it has a mass adoption of a different way to do things, and since so many people are paying for it, they must appreciate the product/service. Do you know any billion dollar companies who have affected such a behavior
04/06/2020, 21:45 - +91 98190 07259: Who have not* affected
04/06/2020, 21:48 - Anuj Gupta: Within tech, the "must have created value" argument is sometimes true, although even there efficiency optimizations that often lead to labour exploitation down the line. Outside tech, it's even murkier - real estate, energy, banking all operate in the $1b+ zone by playing the field and not necessarily creating value
04/06/2020, 21:48 - Anuj Gupta: Related: https://stallman.org/apple.html
04/06/2020, 21:53 - +91 96633 75213: When you say 'big source of income', I'm assuming you mean that the money is put to work in a diversified portfolio (e.g. index funds and bonds). So it's also a predictable source in a way? Did you mean something else?

Also consider what you mean when you say that there's no retirement possible. With every passing year, a younger, hungrier, more adaptable rival of yours is entering the workforce. How long can you keep working until you're let go because there's a faster, cheaper alternative available? You become more aware of this as you get older. Today one can claim that experience matters, and that you should have a growth mindset and never stop learning. But that's what everyone is doing now - plus, information is being shared more fluidly today than it was just 10 years ago. Experience that might have taken you 15 years to gather a decade before is probably being done in 5 now.

Age will act against us (atleast for the majority of us), so I don't know how sure we can be they there's a suitable job for us when we're in 2040-50.
04/06/2020, 21:55 - +91 96633 75213: Suitable = increasing access to personal power and wealth.
04/06/2020, 21:57 - +91 96633 75213: (I'm also mindful that this group here has significant privilege and the ability to stay competitive longer than our average Indian peer. They have it a lot worse than we do. E.g. middle management in service companies)
04/06/2020, 21:57 - +91 96112 56611: Nice perspective.

I meant a leadership income level Vs a SDE 2 income.

I assume there is higher likelihood of being employed as a software developer than as director of product / head of product because of sheer number of positions .
04/06/2020, 21:59 - +91 96112 56611: Also never invested a dime in stock market in last 10 years so not really the guy who banks on it.
04/06/2020, 22:03 - +91 96633 75213: The assumption here is that there will be enough software developer jobs. Software development as we know it is changing, you might not need as many engineers to make something as we did earlier. Case in point - nocode/lowcode tools.

I don't know enough to discuss the silver linings/dark clouds angle of the future of software, so I'm just figuring out my exit strategy / stay-sane strategy. üòä
04/06/2020, 22:05 - +91 96633 75213: Well, I'm also not the right person to say 'invest in the stock market', but I'd suggest you consider what it might take for you to not be dependent on any one source for your sustenance.
04/06/2020, 22:05 - +91 96112 56611: I agree.
software development might change.

I'd like to hope and believe at least some kind of slightly deep work will still exist :)

But yes, being hands-on is going to be an advantage (learning habit for deep skills)
04/06/2020, 22:07 - +91 96633 75213: And while you're learning skills for this deep work (whenever it comes), what is the middle class smart fresher doing?

Objects in the mirror are closer than they may appear. üòâ
(Another thing I observed when I crossed 35).
04/06/2020, 22:14 - +91 96112 56611: Likely. 
Also, they will definitely have more time to grow deep!
04/06/2020, 22:17 - +91 96633 75213: Don't underestimate the hunger. They're still living on <5000 pocket money per month.

That sudden rush of motivation that you get when you get 20k per month for the first time, with hopefully a supportive work environment, can have a slingshot effect.
04/06/2020, 22:19 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Employability will definitely lower with age, and that's why 'creating' skills are critical.
04/06/2020, 22:20 - +91 99870 94433: do you reckon there is an inflection point on the age / employability chart with a sudden drop? 40? 50? out of curiosity.
04/06/2020, 22:21 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Yeah a bunch of 40 is the new 60 articles there.
04/06/2020, 22:22 - +91 96112 56611: I think in the start up world 37 is the new 60 :P
Correct me if I am wrong.
04/06/2020, 22:22 - +91 99870 94433: so at 37 you retire / become a vc?
04/06/2020, 22:23 - +44 7867 389889: Someone made a point about "never retiring", there is some very valuable research from one of my favourite professors Lynda Gratton. She's a thought leader in the space.

"many currently in their 20s will live to be over 100 and will be working into their late 70s, and even into their 80s."

04/06/2020, 22:23 - +44 7867 389889: so @919663375213 $1m may still be a stretch to live with
04/06/2020, 22:23 - +91 99870 94433: 1m wont seem like a lot given housing/edu/inflation
04/06/2020, 22:23 - +91 96112 56611: It's like at 37 you may have an unemployment stint of 1 or 2 years.
04/06/2020, 22:24 - +91 99870 94433: the easy appreciation on real estate that the previous generation in india had won't continue
04/06/2020, 22:25 - Ujjwal Trivedi: Idk. No age is safe tbh
04/06/2020, 22:28 - +91 96633 75213: And that's why we're talking about diversification of savings. Playing our cards right reduces the risk of ballooning costs.
04/06/2020, 22:29 - +91 99870 94433: i dunno. bit of a zero sum game for the salaried / non ESOPed. if you are second generation middle/upper then you have inheritance / property. otherwise a major chunk of your salary and then assets goes towards primary residence.
04/06/2020, 22:32 - +91 99870 94433: perhaps a better topic for the investments fork lol
04/06/2020, 22:35 - +91 97437 82962: I think even $1M in 20 years will be pretty average for retirement. Last time calculated I arrived around 1.5 - 1.7M as floor and like others, $10 M as a stretch.
04/06/2020, 22:46 - +91 72591 76020: I think one needs to 1. Build a brand/trust and 2. build an independent stream of income. Some skills can become irrelevant old too fast, and money can lose value equally fast. Learning is the greatest skill of them all
04/06/2020, 22:47 - +91 99870 94433: that's a bit generic. depends on what you learn. learning to paint cars won't get you far in india :p
04/06/2020, 22:48 - +91 72591 76020: lol :)
04/06/2020, 23:38 - Jasnoor Gill: That's inflation/cost of living. 1M$ today is very different from 1M in 20 years
05/06/2020, 02:57 - Deepa Venkatraman: *Poll*

1. In addition to WhatsApp, you have at least one messaging app (Telegram, Signal etc.) 

2. If this group moved out of WhatsApp to Telegram (say) you would switch to it

I'm not advocating anything here, just satisfying my curiosity.

05/06/2020, 04:36 - +44 7867 389889: @919740099968 - here‚Äôs a thought. Over in the U.K. we have similar PM groups and although we are not as active the number of members are quite the same. We‚Äôve seen quite a bit of success with Slack.

Side effects
- not all the messages will continue to be visible
- not all the content will continue to be available

There‚Äôs a message limit per channel I guess and sort of a LIFO queue.

Upsides
- there is no limit on the number of users
- one stop shop for as many forks as you want
- potentially we could work on some sort of community sponsorship model to make it premium so we unlock a bit more from Slack. 

Have a think.
05/06/2020, 04:37 - Aayush: All of this is already in the works
05/06/2020, 04:38 - Aayush: I will let @919873522057 do rest of the talking on this
05/06/2020, 04:38 - +44 7867 389889: üëåüèª - Sorry, just barged in today so made a noise
05/06/2020, 04:38 - Aayush: No no the thought is exactly the same
05/06/2020, 04:39 - Aayush: So there is going to be a questionnaire of sorts which will sort of look for similar answers / we do a deep dive and figure path of least resistance x product of most community features
05/06/2020, 04:40 - +44 7867 389889: This is some serious Product Management stuff going on here man. ü§ü

05/06/2020, 04:41 - +44 7867 389889: I‚Äôll look forward to the metric on this one. It‚Äôs going to be an interesting one.
05/06/2020, 04:43 - Aayush: I made that metric up in thin air right now but this is what seems to be happening which Maanav is spearheading, I think he will disclose it tomorrow or day after as he told in today‚Äôs standup.

05/06/2020, 10:10 - Aayush: 1. Slack (over Telegram) because of threading and nested discussions so knowledge doesn‚Äôt get lost over time
2. Yes
05/06/2020, 10:17 - +91 96866 27129: Well short term you‚Äôll lose some users but long term it might help in monetising the audience
05/06/2020, 10:40 - Jasnoor Gill: Slack you ll lose the discussions anyway (assuming free)
05/06/2020, 10:43 - +91 98203 02145: IMO INR 200 per month is a small price to pay per person to be part of the community.
05/06/2020, 10:45 - Preetam Nath: Would happily pay. Paying $49/mo for some other communities and the curation and quality of people are simply exceptional. Need more such high quality communities
05/06/2020, 10:52 - +91 97571 63031: +1. Threaded conversations would help save a ton of notifications.
05/06/2020, 10:52 - Maanav Investopad: Hey, we are already testing various platforms for this. 
There are features that the community would need, such as threaded conversations, maybe even polls for conversations like these.
05/06/2020, 10:57 - Maanav Investopad: For eg. This poll itself gave me like 100+ unread messages, where as this could be just one message on a community platform
05/06/2020, 10:59 - Preetam Nath: Yes! Or even emoji responses to the original post :D
05/06/2020, 11:00 - Maanav Investopad: Haha yeah. Don't think Telegram offers that either
05/06/2020, 11:07 - +91 77618 44042: 1. No
2. Yes

Coming back to WhatsApp whenever I get the time and reading trough the thread without having to jump to different channels works for me actually. So, anything that replicates this UX would be great. 

Having said that, I am only on this fork. so I am already missing the chats on other channels/forks ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

05/06/2020, 11:36 - Preetam Nath: Q. How many communities are you a part of in Telegram.
05/06/2020, 11:38 - +44 7774 406149: 2
05/06/2020, 11:42 - +91 96896 39098: Slack preferred : 
1. channels = no more forks, 
2. threads and repo of the conversation
3. plus searchable
4. profile of person is also clear when interacting

For keeping it pay only +1
05/06/2020, 11:42 - Preetam Nath: Could that be a reason for lesser engagement on Slack? Being part of 10 communities is like being part of none, since nobody has the mindspace to engage with 10 communities.
05/06/2020, 11:43 - Preetam Nath: +1 on paid only
05/06/2020, 11:50 - +44 7774 406149: Well I am not even these 10 communities‚Äô dau/mau. They are just sitting as icon on my slack. So I am sure it‚Äôs not a problem of mind space. Of course only time will tell, if we have already decided to move this community to slack.

05/06/2020, 12:35 - Nachi: jsut curious, why do you think so? how does someone pay for essential resources, tools etc?
05/06/2020, 12:39 - +91 72591 76020: They start off being access control, then to keep operations running and the bar high you need more money. Later you realize the money is a bad way to filter. 

Nothing really good exits between Twitter & Patreon

I have also been a part of a paid slack group, as much junk as a free one
05/06/2020, 12:39 - +91 99375 36453: I second this.
05/06/2020, 12:42 - +91 99375 36453: The charges add a layer of filtration but don't bomb the idea of communities
05/06/2020, 12:42 - +91 98184 17804: Would not pay for just a WhatsApp group
05/06/2020, 12:43 - +91 72591 76020: They add expectations from the community, put no expectation on the users of the community
05/06/2020, 12:43 - +91 98184 17804: If you want to make a paid offering should offer a lot more than access. That will hinder people who cannot afford but want help to be part of it
05/06/2020, 12:44 - +91 72591 76020: Going to a high-end restaurant does not mean you won't come across bad folks
05/06/2020, 12:45 - +91 72591 76020: It works the other way, it puts more expectation on the "community" and less on the user
05/06/2020, 12:45 - +91 95609 85630: Just curious, what would you pay for? There are multiple paid slack channels these days. (Trying to uncover the differentiating factor)
05/06/2020, 12:45 - +91 99375 36453: That's when you only have money in the pocket as the only filtration method
05/06/2020, 12:46 - +91 99375 36453: What if the restaurant said, referrals only?
05/06/2020, 12:46 - +91 98184 17804: I think you‚Äôll limit reach of less privileged users
05/06/2020, 12:47 - +91 98184 17804: Fundamentally I‚Äôm not disagreeing that there are paid communities in the world
05/06/2020, 12:47 - +91 98184 17804: I was just saying giving honest feedback
05/06/2020, 12:47 - +91 98184 17804: That I wouldn‚Äôt pay for just a WhatsApp group
05/06/2020, 12:47 - +91 99375 36453: Agreed.
05/06/2020, 12:47 - +91 72591 76020: Won't work. Again, if I am paying, why am I doing the moderation by my referral effort.
05/06/2020, 12:48 - +91 72591 76020: This is a user "positioning" this community BTW. Sorry to place you on the spot Sid :P
05/06/2020, 12:48 - +91 98184 17804: Then you‚Äôre just creating invite only which anyway this is right in a way?
05/06/2020, 12:48 - +91 95609 85630: I get that. I‚Äôm just trying to see what differentiation one sees in paid communities?

1. High quality curated content
2. High quality engaging network of people

Anything else?

05/06/2020, 12:50 - +91 72591 76020: I think a better way to start the conversation is.. name your favorite paid community, which you are active in
05/06/2020, 12:50 - +91 99375 36453: And invite only an have a payment layer in between, can't they?
05/06/2020, 12:50 - +91 72591 76020: Superhuman is not a community
05/06/2020, 12:50 - +91 72591 76020: :P
05/06/2020, 12:51 - +91 99375 36453: Let's start from here. 

Name a community (that you're a part of) apart from this which is facing these problems like us (I'm sure there would be many). Idea is to backtrack their solutions and learn.
05/06/2020, 12:52 - +91 72591 76020: Define the problem too.. in 160 chars
05/06/2020, 12:53 - +91 99375 36453: Bilkul
05/06/2020, 12:53 - +91 72591 76020: and move the conversation to the community fork

06/06/2020, 10:32 - +91 72591 76020: why is it not working out for them, given that restaurants probably have not picked up to past levels
06/06/2020, 10:33 - Jasnoor Gill: Also a focus thing, Amazon just entered their core market too
06/06/2020, 10:33 - +91 72591 76020: Delivering a Quality product is a whole different ball game, and the quality depends on the delivery persons capability ... this would be my guess.. never used it though.
06/06/2020, 10:34 - +91 72591 76020: Possible
06/06/2020, 10:35 - Jasnoor Gill: + once things opened up post initial lockdown, demand would go down as well.
06/06/2020, 10:35 - +91 72591 76020: Focus vs foresight

06/06/2020, 10:44 - +91 91080 14100: Grocery margins at your neighborhood Kirana level are 5%
06/06/2020, 10:45 - +91 91080 14100: If they are going after just the immediate top up usecase both ASP and Margins ( or marketplace fees ) are worse off than Food
06/06/2020, 10:46 - +91 91080 14100: Not sure if you'd noticed Swiggy says 2 hours for grocery and loads really high delivery fees
06/06/2020, 10:46 - +91 91080 14100: 2 hours with the hope to batch multiple orders
06/06/2020, 10:46 - +91 91080 14100: High fee to compensate for lack of margins
06/06/2020, 10:47 - +91 91080 14100: In anycase that feels like a playbook these guys aren't used to , ergo the Rs 100 Biryani to get orders
06/06/2020, 10:49 - +91 91080 14100: If anyone else is studying Grocery aka the flavour of the season very deeply, ping me, would love to chat

06/06/2020, 11:15 - +91 72591 76020: Can you share the url? The answer depends on what is making it slow.. CDNs, Image delivery, better code, reduced code etc etc
06/06/2020, 11:17 - +91 91080 14100: How does one triage this ?

06/06/2020, 11:21 - +91 72591 76020: Depends on what is causing the problem.. if you have a lot of images.. make sure you are using an image delivery service.. if you are using a DB oriented CMS, make sure that is fast, and you have caching in place.

Simpler things are .. make sure you don't have too many 3rd part libs, for images compress before you upload

Hi All,

I  am based out of Mumbai and currently work with MXPlayer, one of the leading OTT platforms in India. Here, I am responsible for building their Games division (current portfolio of 20+ hyper casual games; playing DAUs of 150K+). Before MXPlayer, I was leading the product team of RummyCircle, the biggest operator (be revenue) in Real Money Gaming space in India. During my tenure (of 5.5 yrs), we grew in revenue by 10x.
I am passionate about the gaming space and enjoy deconstructing, analysing and building new games; look forward to contributing to this community.
06/06/2020, 18:02 - Deepa Venkatraman: Excited to see what comes of this. Please keep us all posted.

To address some of the other questions that have come up,

1. It would be nice for the community to not be gated by payment. If possible, rely on people who can afford to to support it (myself included).

2. Personally, I like that this platform isn't on Slack (because there's a temptation to start working on Slack), but I get why Slack is a great platform for this.

3. I'd like to get off FB owned products. WhatsApp is my last vice.
06/06/2020, 18:25 - Amit Singh: Guys, 
Anybody used Paytm's Payment Gateway? 
And specificially their mobile SDK? https://developer.paytm.com/docs/all-in-one-sdk/

07/06/2020, 14:12 - Nazz: ‚ÄúSummary: Intercom on Product Management‚Äù by Mark Opanasiuk https://link.medium.com/FFiTPTgs76

For those of you who really wanted to read the book but never had the time.
07/06/2020, 14:19 - +91 97437 82962: Okay, I might have disabled since then as I always had concerns about people knowing my mobile number can be misused for UPA.
07/06/2020, 14:20 - +91 97437 82962: Yes, checked it. By default it is enabled.
07/06/2020, 17:27 - Nazz: A friend is struggling with Apple declining the app submission as the integrated payment gateway uses web APIs, not a native SDK. Any workarounds?
07/06/2020, 17:28 - +91 72591 76020: What is he/she selling in the app?
07/06/2020, 17:29 - +91 72591 76020: As in ... digital or physical goods ?
07/06/2020, 17:48 - Nazz: A course
07/06/2020, 17:49 - Preetam Nath: Is the content to be consumed using the app itself?
07/06/2020, 17:49 - Preetam Nath: If yes, afaik you can't skip the native SDK
07/06/2020, 17:55 - +91 72591 76020: If it is digital, it has to go via the in-app SDK, and apple will charge a 30% fee
07/06/2020, 17:55 - +91 72591 76020: one reason you can't buy Kindle books in the kindle app
07/06/2020, 17:55 - +91 72591 76020: rather the only reason
07/06/2020, 18:01 - +91 99020 11644: But you can charge on a website
07/06/2020, 18:01 - +91 72591 76020: Correct

07/06/2020, 21:32 - Nazz: So, what to do if the payment gateway doesn't have an Apple SDK?
07/06/2020, 21:33 - Prashant Singh Paytm: Anyone looking for a data warehouse and analytics professional.10 year of work exp .  Skills include SQL tableau Informatica , R and R studio, data visualization,AzureML , Kinme etc .
07/06/2020, 21:35 - Prashant Singh Paytm: A good friend is looking for opportunities in this space
07/06/2020, 21:56 - +91 72591 76020: Does not matter ... all payments for digital goods need to go via Apple
07/06/2020, 21:57 - +91 72591 76020: It is not about them having an sdk

07/06/2020, 22:16 - +91 97437 82962: What % would be on the back of pirated movies floating around in Telegram?
07/06/2020, 22:19 - Jasnoor Gill: How do I get on one of those groups? üòÅ
07/06/2020, 22:20 - Aayush: Less than that of adult groups on WhatsApp for sure
07/06/2020, 22:36 - +91 97437 82962: Search for a specific series or movie + telegram on Google
07/06/2020, 22:40 - Jasnoor Gill: üôè
07/06/2020, 22:45 - +91 88617 98719: Telegram is new age torrent.. you get everything out there...
07/06/2020, 22:48 - Preetam Nath: How does one discover telegram groups? Is it Google search or are there directories?
07/06/2020, 22:56 - +91 99305 30939: Telegram has search on group names
07/06/2020, 22:59 - Deepak Sahoo exRIL, VentureBasecamp: I think you mean channels. Channel is like a broadcast list that you can subscribe to, can't post there. Most content sharing happens on channels. Can be discovered in telegram search.
08/06/2020, 09:27 - +91 98929 43123: Given the addiction to a whatsapp a deeper insight may be hourly active users :)

08/06/2020, 10:12 - Jasnoor Gill: Anyone else get this?
08/06/2020, 10:13 - Ankit Pansari: Wow! Drivers actually read such lengthy emails?
08/06/2020, 10:20 - Mitalee: Quick Q - any feature in zoom that stops users from unmuting themselves after being muted by the host? The school teacher of my kid is desparately tying to stop the kids from their enthusiastic 'good morning ma'am's.
08/06/2020, 10:20 - +91 97174 23467: Don‚Äôt think so. Just that, we in comm. dept. speak fluent English and assume the same for our customers as well. I worked in Real Money Gaming space and saw all the time that players don‚Äôt understand at all the emails that we sent them.
08/06/2020, 11:23 - Ujjwal Trivedi: An excellent summary of Taleb's book- https://twitter.com/mtrajan/status/1252540054901108737
08/06/2020, 11:26 - +91 97046 73794: Yes. There is an option to allow participants to unmute themselves. Uncheck it.

Steps: Participants icon > Participant list > bottom right three dots (more) > Uncheck 'Allow participants to unmute themselves. 

works only if you are a host/ co-host.
08/06/2020, 11:27 - Mitalee: Thanks a lot
08/06/2020, 11:48 - +91 93807 40700: C.Y.A. things.

08/06/2020, 15:14 - Prashant Singh Paytm: I am hard pressed to find a frequent usecase
08/06/2020, 15:14 - +91 98101 12831: Do you have an invite?
I'm waiting to try
08/06/2020, 15:15 - +91 96112 56611: I do. the USP before you ask is : saving a block under MULTIPLE pages/tages.
Notion is hierarchical. RoamResearch is not.
08/06/2020, 15:18 - +91 72591 76020: I have... we can do a zoom to play around :)
08/06/2020, 15:19 - +91 98101 12831: Can do :)
08/06/2020, 15:19 - Nikhil Kumar: Can one invite another?
08/06/2020, 15:19 - Nazz: Please. Let's do a Roam Research walkthrough/ teardown.
08/06/2020, 15:19 - +91 96112 56611: Prime example : To do list.
Imagine you wanted to see all the tasks you have marked for yourself across an array of projects at one place.
Backlinking allows you to edit these very tasks at both places. the pages themselves + the unified tag [tasks].
The bigger advantage though is to be able to assign multiple tags to the same task. Giving you more control stuff like : [Important][Urgent]
08/06/2020, 15:20 - +91 96112 56611: share it on youtube - so we could learn from it as well :)
08/06/2020, 15:20 - +91 72591 76020: It is actually targeted to research folks, which is why they are pricing out normal users
08/06/2020, 15:22 - +91 72591 76020: who is up for a 4 pm zoom call to play around with Roam?
08/06/2020, 15:23 - Nazz: Me
08/06/2020, 15:33 - Aamna Khan: Lots of videos already. This is extensive - https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam
08/06/2020, 15:34 - Nazz: Thanks @919769503268
08/06/2020, 15:40 - +44 7867 389889: Folks, I've heard that we have quite a few ecommerce gurus on this group. Any pimcore experts here ? please DM !
08/06/2020, 15:45 - Ankit Pansari: So now I use Apple Notes for quick notes. Google Keep for quick browser notes. Evernote for clipping. Notion for long form notes and now Roam Research ü§Ø
08/06/2020, 15:46 - +91 98101 12831: Why do you use so many products?
08/06/2020, 15:47 - Ankit Pansari: Speed and Relevance.
08/06/2020, 15:47 - +91 72591 76020: If you are on a mac, try Keepit, I was a hardcore EverNote user, migrated to Keepit as evernote keeps getting worse
08/06/2020, 15:49 - +91 98101 12831: I doubt if multi-product usage could ever drive speed and relevance
08/06/2020, 15:49 - Ankit Pansari: - Apple Notes works best for Mac and IPhone.
- Keep is amazing well in clipping browser notes and Google Calendar linked notes.
- I have not yet found a better article clipper and OCR then Evernote.
- and then there is Notion.

I am getting a shortcut paralysis these days. 
-
08/06/2020, 15:51 - +91 96112 56611: Regardless of number of tools by varied contexts. IMHO : May be what a lot of us need is a consistent habit of daily assimilation. 
In the current distracted world - that I think is the biggest hindrance to a better productivity.
I have often found myself NEVER go back to so much of what I have written or what I bookmarked.
Curious to know how others deal with it.
08/06/2020, 15:51 - +91 81233 27117: Try Bear.app if you are heavily ~~locked~~ invested on the apple ecosystem. Evernote's underrated feature is cheap pricing for India & Scannable.
08/06/2020, 15:52 - +91 98101 12831: I wonder if there is a better single-product possible to really make sense of notes etc.
08/06/2020, 15:52 - Jasnoor Gill: Unsolved issue, too much to do, too little time, like my Pocket unread articles list. Only thing after a while is to purge and start again.
08/06/2020, 15:53 - Jasnoor Gill: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 15:53 - Ankit Pansari: Try using Zettelkasten form of storing and accessing reading material https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1

08/06/2020, 15:57 - +91 96112 56611: +1 such a refined collection of opinions/insights. Very useful.
08/06/2020, 15:58 - +91 72591 76020: folks, me and Himanshu are on zoom for 30 looking at roam research: https://us04web.zoom.us/j/4765672586?pwd=Z2s2VmNoMDlRRGpZQjNCRHdhK0w0dz09
08/06/2020, 16:00 - Suhas Motwani PM: Also personal exp:

Keep it simple in the beginning. Especially Notion. Early on when you‚Äôre setting up you‚Äôll feel like adding all the things and a nice structure. But what‚Äôs important is the content and your process. Start simple and keep adding as you go. Consistency >> everything else. 

TBH: Dropped off from Notion the first time I started using it, found it complex (?) switched back to google docs. Now getting everything in place slowly

Maybe just me, but thought it might help
08/06/2020, 16:00 - Suhas Motwani PM: Do share notes post the discussion :)
08/06/2020, 16:18 - +91 98101 12831: Absolutely agree!
Same feels
08/06/2020, 16:25 - Aayush: This message was deleted
08/06/2020, 16:26 - Aayush: How have these products, helped you achieve something in specific?

Like physical notes vs google notes vs notion vs you-name-it

What are the particular value adds / moved the needle on something
08/06/2020, 16:29 - +91 97571 63031: I was checking out Zettelkasten yesterday and had the exact same experience. I first need to develop more of my writing habit before optimising it even further.

From my summary note - 
"The Zettelkasten system requires way too much work for every single note, and hence the outcome might be that I won't be able to start taking notes in the first place."
08/06/2020, 16:32 - +91 96112 56611: Well put : Consistency>> everything else .
08/06/2020, 16:39 - Suhas Motwani PM: Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for

For me Notion as a tool helps collate everything I‚Äôm doing in one place (which was earlier in maybe Evernote, drive, etc)

Can hopefully have something tangible to share with you in 6m, for now it‚Äôs been more focus on the process. 2 main things so far:
- Wanted to practice writing more often, noticed that documenting/note taking helps so I‚Äôm not starting with a blank slate
- Bunch of side projects, helps in tracking progress and learnings (again having it one place just speeds up things wrt plan)
08/06/2020, 16:41 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: Scannable is magic.
08/06/2020, 16:41 - Suhas Motwani PM: Yeah haha, start really small. It‚Äôs been really helpful but depends on your goals. One thing I‚Äôm starting to notice is connecting dots with the help of tags. Maybe Roam does it better but it‚Äôs a start
08/06/2020, 16:42 - Suhas Motwani PM: ü§û
08/06/2020, 16:42 - Suhas Motwani PM: Part of Evernote?
08/06/2020, 16:43 - Suhas Motwani PM: Or is this something else?
08/06/2020, 16:44 - Srikrishnan Freshdesk: Part on android I believe. Separate app on iOS. I don‚Äôt have Evernote but always use scannable for doc scanning. Vastly superior to camscanner or any other apps around.
08/06/2020, 17:13 - +91 72591 76020: If you are on iOS, apple notes does a good job of scanning, and anything that used iOS's Scanning SDK
08/06/2020, 18:51 - +91 98101 12831: Any Product Hunt experts here - would love to learn on how to seed there

09/06/2020, 15:08 - Jasnoor Gill: This
09/06/2020, 15:09 - +91 98186 49039: Damn. @919937536453, you may want to let your ex colleagues know about this
09/06/2020, 15:10 - +91 96112 56611: the bigger fear is this kind of things is happening at banking processes also. 
These people actually thus know the size of your wallet - and got knows what.
09/06/2020, 15:10 - +91 96112 56611: *god
09/06/2020, 15:11 - +91 96112 56611: Imagine selling you a house because you have an fixed deposit of x lacs.
09/06/2020, 15:12 - Jasnoor Gill: of course they do.
09/06/2020, 15:12 - +91 96112 56611: The interesting this is they are doing it the way google does it.
You have an intent of doing some investment - and they are catching the right person at the right time :D
09/06/2020, 15:12 - Jasnoor Gill: zilch consequences, so why would anyone care
09/06/2020, 15:13 - Aayush: This is the real motivation
09/06/2020, 15:15 - +91 98186 49039: In Singapore (and possibly in European countries), unsolicited marketing sms or calls can land you in jail. They will at the minimum call you to court if you can't prove user has not opted into receiving this communication.
09/06/2020, 15:16 - +91 96112 56611: Agree. Cyber crime / data theft is a joke in India.
Unless you literally siphon off money - no one really cares :)
09/06/2020, 15:16 - Jasnoor Gill: I just make sure i report them with the DND app, but complaints often get closed saying consumer opted in etc
09/06/2020, 15:17 - +91 96112 56611: I never used DND. Just moved to a new sim - and the old sim is a separate phone which is only touched for banking transactions. Most of the time even switched off :P

09/06/2020, 16:30 - +91 87930 00818: This is really inspiring from Zoho founder
09/06/2020, 16:39 - +91 88843 00220: üëçüèª
09/06/2020, 16:40 - Abhishek Tiwari: also supports RSS which, down the line will tell women what clothes to wear, which gods are legit, so there goes my inspiration üôà

09/06/2020, 16:41 - Aayush: (No no no / One fork is enough guys / come on)
09/06/2020, 16:42 - Aayush: Let‚Äôs not get into politics please.
09/06/2020, 16:42 - Aayush: Kindly stick to the topic at hand / you can be inspired by someone‚Äôs work without going to believe his political ideology.
09/06/2020, 16:43 - +91 99375 36453: Yes please!
09/06/2020, 16:46 - +91 95609 85630: üí™üèª
09/06/2020, 17:02 - +91 97690 03072: To separate the art from the artist or to not, has been an age old debate to be honest.
09/06/2020, 17:02 - Aayush: My request would be to do it minus which we would become a debating platform and definitely not a PM forum
09/06/2020, 17:03 - Aayush: In society, that debate has its place
09/06/2020, 17:03 - Aayush: Not in a forum whose preamble is very clear about what it is and therefore also what it is not to a large extent
09/06/2020, 17:15 - Abhishek Tiwari: you are right - my bad üôèüèΩ
09/06/2020, 17:47 - Ujjwal Trivedi: @917720020392 any preparation before the session? - assuming zero knowledge.
09/06/2020, 18:01 - +91 97426 08800: yay!
09/06/2020, 18:17 - +91 98190 07259: Awesome! Looking forward

09/06/2020, 18:32 - Nazz: No man. Come uninitiated! üôÇ üëæ
09/06/2020, 18:34 - Nazz: Would suggest come with questions on Scalability and selling to stakeholders especially CTOs. I have learnt some hard lessons pushing the concept of NoCode and Visual Developers through in a very traditional large company.
09/06/2020, 18:35 - Aayush: Also hiring for the same
09/06/2020, 18:36 - Aayush: I think people might also be interested in knowing how you have tried to build a team around this as well (therefore scalable / valuable) internally
09/06/2020, 18:36 - Aayush: You have hired at least 1/2 people in this role, if I remember correctly
09/06/2020, 18:37 - Nazz: Yes
09/06/2020, 18:39 - +91 77618 44042: Registered!! Looking forward to this üëç
09/06/2020, 19:06 - Kartic Rakhra: üî•üî•üî•
09/06/2020, 19:11 - +91 98184 17804: trained a customers support person to build no-code flows for support teams :)
09/06/2020, 19:11 - +91 98184 17804: it's been a breeze
09/06/2020, 22:08 - +91 97418 25657: Wondering if any of you are aware when does Android trigger a prompt to its users suggesting if they would like to turn off notifications for a particular app. (Ex. If a user has not clicked on a notification for x times)
09/06/2020, 22:09 - +91 97418 25657: <Media omitted>
09/06/2020, 22:10 - +91 93807 40700: On Android 10, the option is always available with a long press on any notification. Haven't gotten a trigger to turn off as such.
09/06/2020, 22:21 - +91 99005 74294: Yes. Had a chat with him today üòä
09/06/2020, 22:23 - +91 99005 74294: Will check out those other tools too. Thanks for sharing!
